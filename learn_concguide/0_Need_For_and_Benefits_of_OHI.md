# **Need for and Benefits of an Ocean Health Index**

> The Index is the first assessment framework that provides a common platform for scientifically combining and comparing key elements from all dimensions of the ocean to measure how sustainably people are using the ocean.

Marine management today requires establishing comprehensive management objectives that maximize the ocean-derived benefits delivered to people while at the same time keeping oceans healthy. This requires a dynamic cycle of understanding current conditions, developing and enacting strategic management, and understanding how conditions have changed in response. The Ocean Health Index (OHI, or, the Index) was developed to support this growing need by providing a framework that quantifies overall how well ocean-derived benefits are delivered to people now and in the future. The Index is the first assessment tool that provides a common platform for scientifically combining and comparing key elements from all dimensions of the oceans health — biological, physical, economic, and social – to measure how sustainably people are using the ocean.

Overall Index scores are a combination of components, known as **goals**, of ocean health. Goal scores are calculated using the best available data and indicators within the spatial scale of the assessment. Scores reflect how well coastal regions optimize their potential ocean benefits and services in a sustainable way relative to a reference point or policy target, on a scale of 0 to 100. The Index was developed as a framework to assess coastal oceans in a formulaic manner, and was designed to be customizable given different scales, data availabilities, and cultural priorities. In this way, it can be tailored to fit any spatial context to meet both ecological and political needs.

The Index framework was created using the best available science to measure and track changes in the various dimensions through a process that is repeatable, transparent, quantitative, and goal-driven. By combining ocean and coastal benefits under a single framework, then, the Index allows for a comprehensive and integrated view of marine systems as well as a better understanding of potential trade-offs or synergies among these goals.

#### How is OHI Different?

As a composite index, the Ocean Health Index integrates the results across disciplines and sectors. The Index is also a highly tailorable approach ready to meet the needs and priorities of those who use the ocean. The Index represents a significant advance over conventional single-sector approaches to assessing sustainability as communicated through other kinds of index efforts.

#### How is it used?

As a management tool, the Index can inform decision-making by helping stakeholders identify geographic and thematic priorities for management, which increases the cost-effectiveness of actions taken. At the same time, it addresses the desire for policymakers to increase environmental performance in the face of tightening budget constraints for natural resource management and conservation, and galvanizes efforts towards ecosystem-based management.
