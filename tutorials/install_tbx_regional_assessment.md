# Installing the Toolbox for a Regional Assessment 

## Getting started
The Ocean Health Index (OHI) Toolbox is software written in R that can be used to conduct regional assessments using the OHI framework. Ocean Health Index assessments have a specific organization of data files, registry files, and R scripts that work together to do calculations and present the final scores graphically. The files and scripts for any given assessment are packaged together in a folder called a **repository** ('repos'), and stored online through GitHub, an open-source development platform that enables easy collaboration with  versioning capabilities (See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub).

It is possible to conduct a regional assessment by downloading a template repository from GitHub. We recommend having a GitHub user account and syncing with the online repository: this faciliates collaboration within your team but also allows us to provide support when you need it. However, it is possible to work independently without GitHub (after the initial download), although we cannot offer much support in this case.

**Requirements**: an Internet connection for the initial Toolbox App installation and continued access if syncing with GitHub (highly recommended); proficiency with data management and the coding language **R**; proficiency in spatial software such as ArcGIS (potentially, depending on the regional assessment strategy).

**1. Set up:**

 * Install R and RStudio
 * Clone regional assessment repository on Desktop

Detailed instructions for step **1** are provided below for users who want to either:

 * work with GitHub (See: Accessing repository with GitHub section), or 
 * work without GitHub (See: Accessing repository without GitHub section). 

**2. Become familiar with the OHI Toolbox File System**


Once the user has completed steps 1 and 2, they will then be able to make changes to the Toolbox to calculate regional scores (See: 'Using the Toolbox for a Regional assessment' section below).
