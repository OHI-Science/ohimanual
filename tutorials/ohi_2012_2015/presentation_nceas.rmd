<!---Today I'm going to talk about what the OHI team has been up to for the past few years. We've had a team of about 5-8 full-time people here at NCEAS and also with our partners at CI. 

I'll give a brief intro to what what OHI was in 2012 when the Nature paper came out, and then get into what we've been doing since then.

<!---

Ben Halpern et al. published this paper in Nature in 2012. It spun off of a working group here at NCEAS about ecosystem health, which was a project with these coauthors for about 3 years.

<!---
The Halpern et al. *Nature* paper reported two things, although they sort of get confounded together. 
1. they developed the OHI assessment framework
2. they did an OHI assessment at the global scale

<!---
Let's talk first about the framework. What is it?

OHI assessment framework is the conceptual design and structure to assess how healthy oceans are. But what does healthy mean? They came up with a deliberate definition of what a healthy ocean is. 

Why do you need something like this? 
Governments around the world are realizing that their oceans are in trouble, and want to change that. But they need some estimate of how their oceans were doing now in order to set priorities and change policy. 
There are several approaches out there, but few are truly comprehensive and it seems like everyone has to reinvent the wheel and no one learns from each other, yet no one has time or resources or familiarity with how you would go about it. 

So the OHI framework here defines what we mean by healthy, and developed a structured way for how to respresent it. This definition provides guidance but boundaries what can be included in the assessment down the line. 

When I say it's important for the definition to guide and bound what can be included later on in the assessment, I think an analogy about human health can help. If you wanted to identify a lot of attributes that exemplify a healthy person, you'd want to have it guided and constrained by some definition of what you mean by health such that elements like maybe weight or bloodpressure would be included, but something like height would not be.

## Ocean Health Index: 2012 recap

<p align = 'center'>![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1vW5Ar6Kx8EyJGr-0x060z9Gg36K4wlXqEiFfXA_r90k/pub?w=768&h=480)

<!---

The definition is 'a healthy ocean sustainably delivers a range of benefits to people now and in the future'. 


This definition explicitly includes humans in this assessment: the purpose is to be relevant for policy so it focuses around what is important to people. 
The range of benefits means that you can categorize many goods and services that the ocean provides, such as providing food, protection from storms, tourism and recreation opportunities, and more intangible things like how cultures feel a sense of place or connection to the ocean. 
The OHI brings all of these benefits together so that they are on the same quantified scoring system, and can then be compared to each other and from there, prioritized for policy. The idea is that you use this repeatedly through time and you would be able to track the changes in ocean health and build policy in response.

<!---
They also developed a way to use the definition so that this framework would have a core part that was standardized and familiar and also a tailored part that would allow this to be flexible in different contexts. Both of these were important so that it's a familar thing that you can build from but that you're not reinventing the wheel. 

- **core:** standardized and familiar
    - an 'OHI assessment' means something
    - easier to uncover decisions and methods 
- **tailored:** flexible to different contexts
    - captures what's important locally
    - can include targets relevant for policy
    - so that you're not reinventing the wheel all the time.

<!---
- **core:** 
    - how goal scores are calculated
    - that each goal needs a reference point (target)
- **tailored:** 
    - which goals to score
    - how reference points are set
    
    
So this is the framework. I'm not going to get into further details here but we will talk about what it looks like in action, in the global asessment.

<!---


OK, so then they did this at the global scale. Conceptually, they identified what is important to measure while bounded by the definition.

<!---
They identified 10 categories of benefits the ocean provides for humans

They scored every coastal nation in the world based on these 10 things. 

Assessments use existing and information available from sources like the World Bank, UN FAO, NGOs etc. Because of data quality, models had to be developed to capture those 10 categories as best they could, but mostly in less-than-perfect ways.

<!---
So that's the quick summary of OHI as of the 2012 Nature paper. You can see how these things can get confounded but it's important that they are separate. 

That distinction is especially important for what I want to talk with you about for the rest of today that has been keeping us so busy.

## OHI: 2012-2015 overview

<!---
So what have we been doing? 
What you might not know these other 4 things:
--->

## OHI: 2012-2015 overview

<p align = 'center'>![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1DCTg7Ttue_FYiWVYdbUD1Vgp77RlNeAijk4n85MtYJA/pub?w=768&h=480)

<!---
- we've done the global every year
- means finding updated data each year: existing information, sourcing quality data and indicators
- refining methods (internal and external critique)
this isn't a talk that is going to get into those scores. We've published a follow up (Halpern et al 2015) and are planning another for the 5-year anniversary---> 

## OHI: 2012-2015 overview

<p align = 'center'>![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1cEb_FgrzFr0YjEVlWEwXXbenxNBLbp6QE6eS-W9Cab4/pub?w=768&h=480)

<!---
- we've developed the Toolbox
- this automates a lot of the assessment process, making those repeated assessments easier
- All in R and RStudio (includes R package)
- all online through GitHub
- user-friendly for us, but also for others. Best computing practices
- transparency, reproducible science, communication
- as a team, we've all grown with this. BB built it and we've been maintaining and building from it. The Toolbox really enables everything that we do.

<!---
- we've done assessments at different scales: Brazil. Fiji. currently in BC>
- differentiated the framework from the global assessment: can be used at different scales
- OHI is supposed to be able to track things through space as well as through time. 
- tested in seeminly data-rich, data-poor. - Documented challenges, etc

Value of doing assessments at smaller scales: can use better data, know the system better, can include local cultural priorities, preferences. More relevant for policy.

<!---
- we've been helping other groups do their own assessments
- that's why I was hired. 
- lots of interest, different motivations
- currently we have 4 completed assessments, 8 others in progress, many others in the wings.

<!---
SO I'm going to talk about these two things today, as well as the resources we're developing based on our experiences and our next steps. These two things go hand in hand because as we've been developing the Toolbox for ourselves, we've needed to make it as user-friendly as possible. 

-The OHI Toolbox
-Examples of OHI+ assessments
-Building from experiences (resources)
-Next Steps

<!---

- organization structure and code
- open source, cross-platform, free 
- assess ocean health as smoothly as possible

Just like the framework, the Toolbox has a standardized portion that not really change, and a tailored part that is flexible for different users.

<!---
What we've been talking about so far here is just one phase in the whole assessment process: conducting the assessment is really our focus here at NCEAS. 
Our colleagues at Conservation International lead a lot of these other steps, with teaching people about assessments and helping them plan. We are also getting into the informing part a bit too, but I'll talk about that in a bit. 

Let's shift gears to talk about some live examples of this
--->
  


## OHI+: independent assessments

<p align = 'center'>![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1OCJO5OcMdJ_u9zCFDVwXH9IJsGrjWzeydXdIAWpnlh8/pub?w=768&h=384)

<!---

- many countries in different stages. Led by gvt, academic, or a combination.
- different motivations. Some are gvt interested in developing policy around it, some are academic interested in comparing it to other methods
- really different places. OHI is a really cool lens to see really different coastlines, from ecological and social.

these aren't going to be comparable directly. not the purpose.

<!---
So now that countries are starting to have scores at small scales, we are excited to see what happens with the Inform stage, both in how they improve their process for next time but also for policy, which is the ultimate goal. 

We have recently been surprised to learn that it can also be useful for policy and make a difference even before scores are calculated. Colombia using this as a policy tool before having calculated scores.

<!---
We are trying to capture what we've learned and built through this whole process.  

We're also developing a community of people who are knowledgble in the conceptual and technical parts of OHI assessments, and it's great. 

build a community where people can share experiences but also work with each other. Stop reinventing the wheel. 

Lauren is revamping this website, this is a figure I stole from her mock-up. It's going to be awesome.

## Appendix 2: Talk abstract part 1/2

The Ocean Health Index (OHI) is a framework to assess the state of our marine systems. With a definition of 'healthy' that includes sustainable human use, the OHI scores locations from 0-100 depending on how sustainably their waters provide a suite of benefits to people. The OHI framework was first used to assess all coastal nations globally, and was published in 2012 (Halpern et al. 2012, Nature). 

Following the 2012 publication, the OHI framework has been used to assess smaller-scale locations, most often states or provinces within a single nation. These smaller spatial scales often have information that better represents local characteristics of marine systems and are also often the scale at which policy decisions are made. 

## Appendix 2: Talk abstract part 2/2

To date, eleven assessments using the OHI framework have been completed at global, national, and regional scales, four of which have been led by independent academic or government groups. To facilitate these assessments, we have developed a suite of open-source tools and instruction. The OHI Toolbox provides structure for data organization and storage, with data processing and goal modeling done in the programming language R and RStudio for reproducibility and repeatability. The OHI Toolbox is stored on the open-source online platform GitHub, which allows for transparency and collaboration and also houses websites to display and communicate methods and results with interactive visualizations. More information can be found at ohi-science.org (currently under a major restructuring and improvement, stay tuned!).
