Most people have heard of the OHI because of Halpern et al 2012.
3 years, interdisciplinary partnerships. It made a splash
Focus not only on that there was a paper, but what they may have heard of.

## The Ocean Health Index 2012 

- scores a suite of benefits to humans ('goals') from 0-100
- ten goals scored in global assessments
- maps and flower plots illustrate scores <br />

But since 2012 there have been 5 full-time researchers, and we have repeated the global assessment through time
Give examples of goals and follow them through. 

Introduce the idea of goals and give exs throughout for a few Fisheries and Tourism. Use these to talk about the reference points, concrete points. Also helps illustrate how ref point is not pristine. And how the ref point isn't max ever: it's msy


ref points as well-informed as possible. based on literature if nothing else

- Cumulative Human Impacts is only the negatives, what about the positives?
- Policy mandates to 'keep oceans healthy' 
- What is a 'healthy ocean'? Must define to measure

<!---
important to define what you're trying to do
-->

## Motivation for developing OHI

**Need for an assessment method that:** 

- **defines 'healthy'**
- **has an explicit purpose** to structure what is included
- **evaluates social and ecological elements** relevant for policy

## Motivation for developing OHI

**Need for an assessment method that:** 

- **defines 'healthy'**; 
- **has an explicit purpose** to structure what is included
- **evaluates social and ecological elements** relevant for policy

and: 

- is **tailorable for use in different contexts** by accommodating local environmental characteristics, cultural priorities, and information quality 

## Motivation for developing OHI

**Additionally must enable:**

- **transparency**: what decisions were made and why
- **reproduciblity**: access to methods and computational code
- **repeatablility**: ability to modify methods and code with context-specific info
- **communicability**: distill complexity with visualization for wide audiences


## OHI Conceptual Blueprint

<p align = 'center'>![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/15abn7jdkiHHFsi_DXbU0tPIMbWJpkZeBTJVBBoS0zdY/pub?w=576&h=192)

 - defines ocean health: <span style="color:blue">*'A healthy ocean sustainably delivers a range of benefits to people now and in the future'*</span>
 - customizable local decisions are distinct from core framework structure
 - assesses a range of benefits, categorized as 'goals'

## OHI Conceptual Blueprint

<p align = 'center'>![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/15abn7jdkiHHFsi_DXbU0tPIMbWJpkZeBTJVBBoS0zdY/pub?w=576&h=192)

This blueprint allows OHI assessments to be familiar in structure and process but customized to capture attributes important to the assessment location.  

This also means that assessments using the OHI framework will not be directly comparable to each other, since they are capturing different attributes specific to the context. This is OK because the *purpose* of the assessment is not to be directly comparable, it is to understand the assessment area. However, it can be useful to compare which areas are closer to reaching their own targets, since all scores are from 0-100.

## OHI Conceptual Blueprint

- which goals are important?
- how should they ideally be represented?
- what are key characteristics and cultural priorities?
- how could reference points be set?
- what are pressures affecting these goals?
- what mitigates these pressures (resilience)?

## OHI Conceptual Blueprint

- goal scores ~ status, likely future state, pressures, resilience
- goal status requires an explicitly set reference point (target)

Then reiterate again how this is familiar but customizable.

then show github diagram thing
then show example repos

where to put ref pt examples?

## OHI Conceptual Blueprint

**Conceptual decisions are made BEFORE gathering information.** 

- blueprint should remain true to the definition of ocean health 


- remain true to the planned goals
    - include indirect (proxy) information
    - highlight knowledge gaps

"it's about the process"
it gives you a framework for thinking about all these things. You've had to think about the ocean in 10 diff ways and you've had to catelog all the things that go in and out, what's missing. So the scores at the end is just the final
And this helps the process because for managers to think about how to improve those numbers, they need to understand the process
''the scientist in me like the process' and the 'manager in me likes the scores'. but really you need to communicate both



Other really good question: 
Q for BH/Court: pressures and resilience and trend. why do you have that if it's already in there? 
it gives the policy makers a lever. The past includes the past resiliences, but if you need to change the trajectory of the scores. Isolate the part you can act on. 

PULL FAQ for ohi-science.org? Like Jorge's ref points, Jaide's comparing TR regions with diff ref points.

Q about weightings


To add re reference points:
Reference points are set specifically to the local context to capture stakeholder priorities such that goal scores reflect progress towards achieving those targets, and future assessments can serve as a measure of the effectiveness of management and policy interventions

## Appendix: Talk abstract part 1/2

The Ocean Health Index (OHI) is a framework to assess the state of our marine systems. With a definition of 'healthy' that includes sustainable human use, the OHI scores locations from 0-100 depending on how sustainably their waters provide a suite of benefits to people. The OHI framework was first used to assess all coastal nations globally, and was published in 2012 (Halpern et al. 2012, Nature). 

Following the 2012 publication, the OHI framework has been used to assess smaller-scale locations, most often states or provinces within a single nation. These smaller spatial scales often have information that better represents local characteristics of marine systems and are also often the scale at which policy decisions are made. 

## Appendix: Talk abstract part 2/2

To date, eleven assessments using the OHI framework have been completed at global, national, and regional scales, four of which have been led by independent academic or government groups. To facilitate these assessments, we have developed a suite of open-source tools and instruction. The OHI Toolbox provides structure for data organization and storage, with data processing and goal modeling done in the programming language R and RStudio for reproducibility and repeatability. The OHI Toolbox is stored on the open-source online platform GitHub, which allows for transparency and collaboration and also houses websites to display and communicate methods and results with interactive visualizations. More information can be found at ohi-science.org (currently under a major restructuring and improvement, stay tuned!).
