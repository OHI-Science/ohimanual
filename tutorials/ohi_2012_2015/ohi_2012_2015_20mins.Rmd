## The Ocean Health Index 2012

<!---
Most people have heard of the OHI because of Halpern et al 2012.
3 years, interdisciplinary partnerships. It made a splash

<!---
But since 2012 there have been 5 full-time researchers, and we have repeated the global assessment through time

we've also tested it at different spatial scales and different degrees of data quality

Plus, we have developed open-source software tools and at training program. And independent groups are doing their own. 
How did this come to be?
I'm going to tell the story of the past 3 years, what OHI has come to be

## Outline

- Motivation for developing OHI
- OHI: an assessment framework
- OHI Toolbox
- Support for independent assessments

## Motivation for developing OHI

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1rFFkxJh3PkW_nh535385KSfxDzf7wMov9gSyqt1xDAs/pub?w=768&h=288)<br />

- Cumulative Human Impacts is only the negatives, what about the positives?


## Motivation for developing OHI

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1rFFkxJh3PkW_nh535385KSfxDzf7wMov9gSyqt1xDAs/pub?w=768&h=288)<br />

- Cumulative Human Impacts is only the negatives, what about the positives?
- Policy mandates to 'keep oceans healthy' 
- What is a 'healthy ocean'? Must define in order to measure

<!---
important to define what you're trying to do

## OHI Framework

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1NCMYez3lMOIBOhtZSZ7PUATKnaTy4uLEzHevvN9XTHk/pub?w=768&h=144)


## OHI Framework: definition

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1NCMYez3lMOIBOhtZSZ7PUATKnaTy4uLEzHevvN9XTHk/pub?w=768&h=144) <br /><br />

<span style="color:blue">*'A healthy ocean sustainably delivers a range of benefits to people now and in the future'*</span> <br /> <br />

 - a healthy ocean is not 'pristine'  
 - human priorities are explicit
 - assesses a range of benefits, categorized as 'goals'

<!---

## OHI Framework: score calculations

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1NCMYez3lMOIBOhtZSZ7PUATKnaTy4uLEzHevvN9XTHk/pub?w=768&h=144)<br />

- score calculations: **current status** + **likely future state**

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1QRZjVzoQpkouiz_6R0tuO9Bf-ymUmw3TwXOzP6CIIuQ/pub?w=768&h=288)

<!---
status + likely future state (made up of 5-year trend and pressures and resilience)
-->

## OHI Framework: context-specific 

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1NCMYez3lMOIBOhtZSZ7PUATKnaTy4uLEzHevvN9XTHk/pub?w=768&h=144)<br /><br />

**Context specific decisions:** 

- which goals are important?
- how should they ideally be measured?
- what are key characteristics of the area?
- what are cultural priorities?
- what are pressures affecting these goals?
- what mitigates these pressures (resilience)?

## OHI Framework: context-specific 

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1NCMYez3lMOIBOhtZSZ7PUATKnaTy4uLEzHevvN9XTHk/pub?w=768&h=144)<br />

Ten goals were identified as important for global assessments:<br />

## OHI Framework

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1NCMYez3lMOIBOhtZSZ7PUATKnaTy4uLEzHevvN9XTHk/pub?w=768&h=144)<br /><br />

**Identify information (data/indicators) to include AFTER context-specific decisions have been made.** 

- information should fit into the framework; the framework should not be built around available information (biases)
- remain true to the planned goals
    - include indirect (proxy) information
    - highlight knowledge gaps


## OHI Framework: scores

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1NCMYez3lMOIBOhtZSZ7PUATKnaTy4uLEzHevvN9XTHk/pub?w=768&h=144)<br />

- OHI scores are on a unitless scale from 0-100
- visualized with maps and flower plots

## OHI calculations overview

Information is required for all regions in an assessment area

## OHI Assessments

The OHI framework is standardized, yet modifiable to suit assessments in different contexts.<br /><br />

The Toolbox and GitHub facilitate assessment calculations, but also organization, remote collaboration, and documentation.

## Support for independent assessments

All resources are at [**ohi-science.org**](http://ohi-science.org)
