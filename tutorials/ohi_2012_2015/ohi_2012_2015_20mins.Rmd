## The Ocean Health Index

<!---
Most people have heard of the OHI because of Halpern et al 2012

But since 2012 there have been 5 full-time researchers, and we have completed many more assessments through space and time.

But since 2012 there have been 5 full-time researchers, and we have completed many more assessments through space and time.
Plus, we have developed open-source software tools and at training program. And independent groups are doing their own. 
How did this come to be?
I'm going to tell the story of the past 3 years, what OHI has come to be

## Outline

- Motivation for developing OHI
- OHI Framework
- OHI Toolbox
- Support for independent assessments
- Best practices for conducting assessments

## Motivation for developing OHI

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1rFFkxJh3PkW_nh535385KSfxDzf7wMov9gSyqt1xDAs/pub?w=768&h=288)

- 
- Cumulative Human Impacts is only the negatives, what about the positives?
- Policy mandates to 'keep oceans healthy' 
- What is a 'healthy ocean'? Must be defined 

<!---
important to define what you're trying to do
explict with humans included--not conservation oriented
not monitoring. need to have human decisions in there of 'what is good'
-->

## OHI Framework

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1NCMYez3lMOIBOhtZSZ7PUATKnaTy4uLEzHevvN9XTHk/pub?w=768&h=144)


## OHI Framework: definition

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1NCMYez3lMOIBOhtZSZ7PUATKnaTy4uLEzHevvN9XTHk/pub?w=768&h=144)

<span style="color:blue">*'A healthy ocean sustainably delivers a range of benefits to people now and in the future'*</span> <br /> <br />

 - a healthy ocean is not 'pristine'  
 - human priorities are explicit
 - assesses a range of benefits, called 'goals'

## OHI Framework: goal scores

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1NCMYez3lMOIBOhtZSZ7PUATKnaTy4uLEzHevvN9XTHk/pub?w=768&h=144)

- goal scores are based on **status** and **likely future state**
- pressures and resilience can affect multiple goals

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1QRZjVzoQpkouiz_6R0tuO9Bf-ymUmw3TwXOzP6CIIuQ/pub?w=768&h=288)

<!---
status + likely future state (made up of 5-year trend and pressures and resilience)

## OHI Framework: context-specific 

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1NCMYez3lMOIBOhtZSZ7PUATKnaTy4uLEzHevvN9XTHk/pub?w=768&h=144)

- ocean benefits are categorized into a suite of **goals**

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1VDqT5eN5eg3dtVZLMrpKNmaDqhCoGvUNjfBJt-2w6s0/pub?w=768&h=288)

## OHI Framework: context-specific 

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1NCMYez3lMOIBOhtZSZ7PUATKnaTy4uLEzHevvN9XTHk/pub?w=768&h=144)

- which goals are important?
- what are key characteristics of the area?
- what are cultural priorities?
- what are pressures affecting these goals?
- what resilience measures are important?
## OHI Framework

scores are calculated for each goal and region, then combined

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1yYTF0KUqe4UFuMKMkvzIM0-TyJh46xFFs13SViIuaqA/pub?w=768&h=480)

## OHI Framework

This framework can be modified to suit different contexts

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1NCMYez3lMOIBOhtZSZ7PUATKnaTy4uLEzHevvN9XTHk/pub?w=768&h=144)

We promote:

- **transparency** about which decisions were made and why 
- **reproducibility** through access to detailed methods and computational code
- **repeatability** by the ability to modify methods and computational code
- **communicability** through visualization to wide audiences

## OHI Toolbox

open-source tools for analysis, visualization and communication 

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1tkwbzMdonCmKVHbiJ-IPy0xyeBfA4RVTVzh7ST-W6Os/pub?w=768&h=384)


## OHI Toolbox: R package

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1tkwbzMdonCmKVHbiJ-IPy0xyeBfA4RVTVzh7ST-W6Os/pub?w=768&h=384)

- R package to calculate scores: 
    - [github.com/ohi-science/ohicore](https://github.com/ohi-science/ohicore)

## OHI Toolbox: context-specific

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1tkwbzMdonCmKVHbiJ-IPy0xyeBfA4RVTVzh7ST-W6Os/pub?w=768&h=384)

- Information is entered into a structured repository:
    - Example [github.com/ohi-science/gye](https://github.com/ohi-science/gye)

## OHI Toolbox: website

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1tkwbzMdonCmKVHbiJ-IPy0xyeBfA4RVTVzh7ST-W6Os/pub?w=768&h=384)

- Methods and scores are displayed on a website:
    - Example [ohi-science.org/gye](http://ohi-science.org/gye)


## Support for independent assessments

## Best practices for OHI assessments

Figure of best practices ms 4 'steps'

<!---
best practices for any assessment 
define a framework for how to comprehensively incoporate all important components. Do this BEFORE thinking about data
look for data that can be used in your framework. Direct and Indirect
develop model equations for how to represent your framework with the information you have. STICK TO THE PLAN
document and share all decisions with writing and computational code.
