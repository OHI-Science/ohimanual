<!---
Most people have heard of the OHI because of Halpern et al 2012.
3 years, interdisciplinary partnerships. It made a splash
Focus not only on that there was a paper, but what they may have heard of.

- scores a suite of benefits to humans ('goals') from 0-100
- ten goals scored in global assessments
- maps and flower plots illustrate scores <br />

## Motivation for developing OHI

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1rFFkxJh3PkW_nh535385KSfxDzf7wMov9gSyqt1xDAs/pub?w=768&h=288)<br />

- Cumulative Human Impacts is only the negatives, what about the positives?
- Policy mandates to 'keep oceans healthy' 
- What is a 'healthy ocean'? Must define to measure

<!---
important to define what you're trying to do

WANTED TO QUANTIFY THESE THINGS

we saw a need: for something that measured OH, there was nothing that was all these things we wanted. we saw a need, we made a def that would fill that need, but then we needed to build something that would do it.

then, from the def, we knew what we were creating had those qualities 

then knew we were including humans in a thing that needed to be compared across things
it was at the benefit-level so we developed categories of benefits ('goals') and then went from there)

we're always working towards those things, but we're not there yet. 

set up this narrative of how the def came first and it's still being tweaked
-->

## Definition and purpose

<span style="color:blue">"A healthy ocean sustainably provides a range of benefits to people now and in the future"</span>

<!---**Need for an assessment method that:** 

- **defines 'healthy'**
- **is comprehensive and holistic** by including multiple sectors
- **has an explicit purpose** to structure what is included
- **evaluates social and ecological elements** relevant for policy
--->

- defines 'ecosystem health' and includes humans (relevant for policy)<!---a healthy ocean--->
- allows comparison across a range of social and ecological elements <!---range of benefits. SAY: goal-driven, ---> 
- quantitative and sensitive to changes and trackable through time + space <!---now and in the future--->


## Developing the OHI Blueprint

**Conceptually, the assessment method must:**

- **provide structure** and bound the information included <!---- benefit-driven, not indicator-driven objective drives the selection of information--->
- **be tailorable** for use in different contexts by accommodating local environmental characteristics, cultural priorities, and information quality 

<!---say social: cultural, economic--->


## Developing the OHI Blueprint

- **provide structure** and bound the information included <!---- benefit-driven, not indicator-driven objective drives the selection of information--->
- **be tailorable** for use in different contexts by accommodating local environmental characteristics, cultural priorities, and information quality 

**Technically, the assessment method must be:**

- **transparent**: what decisions were made and why
- **replicable**: ability to use and modify methods and computational code
- **easy to communicate**: distill complexity with visualization for wide audiences

'Blueprint': local decisions are distinct from core assessment framework structure  
  
Structured by definition of ocean health: assesses a range of benefits that represent what the ocean provides to humans ('goals')  

Uses existing, freely-available information (data/indicators)

**goal status requires an explicitly set reference point (target)**  


<!---

the need for reference points is part of core. How they're set is part of local.


ref points as well-informed as possible. based on literature if nothing else

Reference points are set specifically to the local context to capture priorities such that goal scores reflect progress towards achieving those targets, and future assessments can serve as a measure of the effectiveness of management and policy interventions.

identify and plan: 

- which goals are important and how should they ideally be represented
- key characteristics and cultural priorities to include
- how could reference points be set
- the pressures affecting these goals, and what mitigates these pressures (resilience)

## Example: US West Coast Assessment

<!---Then reiterate again how this is familiar but customizable.-->

**Food Provision - Wild-caught Fisheries**
 
- important fisheries with stock assessments (ref. pt. ~ MSY)
- pressures / resilience: pollution, invasives, fishing / gvt, social


**Tourism and Recreation**
 
- tourism very different among regions (ref. pt. ~ gvt targets?)

## OHI Conceptual Blueprint

**Conceptual blueprint is developed BEFORE data search.** 

- blueprint should remain true to the definition of ocean health 
- blueprint provides structure for information search (and reduces biases)
    - search for direct measures based on blueprint
    - include indirect (proxy) information
    - highlight knowledge gaps

- organization structure and code to calculate OHI scores
- open source, cross-platform, and free 
- get teams assessing ocean health as smoothly as possible

The Toolbox also has this paralleled structure as the conceptual blueprint.

"it's about the process"
it gives you a framework for thinking about all these things. You've had to think about the ocean in 10 diff ways and you've had to catelog all the things that go in and out, what's missing. So the scores at the end is just the final
And this helps the process because for managers to think about how to improve those numbers, they need to understand the process
''the scientist in me like the process' and the 'manager in me likes the scores'. but really you need to communicate both



Other really good question: 
Q for BH/Court: pressures and resilience and trend. why do you have that if it's already in there? 
it gives the policy makers a lever. The past includes the past resiliences, but if you need to change the trajectory of the scores. Isolate the part you can act on.

## Question Slides 1: OHI Conceptual Blueprint

<p align = 'center'>![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/15abn7jdkiHHFsi_DXbU0tPIMbWJpkZeBTJVBBoS0zdY/pub?w=576&h=192)

OHI blueprint allows OHI assessments to be familiar in structure and process but customized to capture attributes important to the assessment location. 

This also means that assessments using the OHI framework will not be directly comparable to each other, since they are capturing different attributes specific to the context. This is OK because the *purpose* of the assessment is not to be directly comparable, it is to understand the assessment area. However, it can be useful to compare which areas are closer to reaching their own targets, since all scores are from 0-100.


## Appendix 2: Talk abstract part 1/2

The Ocean Health Index (OHI) is a framework to assess the state of our marine systems. With a definition of 'healthy' that includes sustainable human use, the OHI scores locations from 0-100 depending on how sustainably their waters provide a suite of benefits to people. The OHI framework was first used to assess all coastal nations globally, and was published in 2012 (Halpern et al. 2012, Nature). 

Following the 2012 publication, the OHI framework has been used to assess smaller-scale locations, most often states or provinces within a single nation. These smaller spatial scales often have information that better represents local characteristics of marine systems and are also often the scale at which policy decisions are made. 

## Appendix 2: Talk abstract part 2/2

To date, eleven assessments using the OHI framework have been completed at global, national, and regional scales, four of which have been led by independent academic or government groups. To facilitate these assessments, we have developed a suite of open-source tools and instruction. The OHI Toolbox provides structure for data organization and storage, with data processing and goal modeling done in the programming language R and RStudio for reproducibility and repeatability. The OHI Toolbox is stored on the open-source online platform GitHub, which allows for transparency and collaboration and also houses websites to display and communicate methods and results with interactive visualizations. More information can be found at ohi-science.org (currently under a major restructuring and improvement, stay tuned!).
