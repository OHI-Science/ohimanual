# Introduction
  
## The Ocean Health Index

**The Ocean Health Index (OHI)** project was created with a strong foundation in communication and collaboration. Following the initial publication by Halpern *et al*. 2012 in *Nature* (available at [ohi-science.org](http://ohi-science.org)), we have conducted annual global assessments to track changes in global ocean health. At the same time, we have been developing the **Ocean Health Index Toolbox** to enable others to conduct assessments on their own using the OHI framework. The Toolbox is more than simply software to calculate scores; it is an ecosystem of materials that facilitate groups to collaborate throughout the assessment process. Here, the **Ocean Health Index Manual** describes how to use the Toolbox.


## The Ocean Health Index Toolbox

**The Ocean Health Index Toolbox** has been developed to facilitate Index assessments at any scale. The Toolbox not only calculates scores, but it provides structure for organizing and managing data, which can be done using any software, and has been created through an online collaborative platform that tracks changes through time. The Toolbox Application (App) is open-source, cross-platform, and runs using the statistical programming language R. The App displays input data and calculated scores graphically with maps, histograms, and tables.  

The Toolbox enables the Ocean Health Index framework to be customized to an area of interest, incorporating the data, indicators, and priorities regarding ocean-derived benefits that are relevant to the chosen study area. The App can additionally be used to compare how different management scenarios could affect overall ocean health, which can inform effective strategies for ocean resource management at a local scale.
