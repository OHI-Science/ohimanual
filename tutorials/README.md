# Introduction
  
## The Ocean Health Index

**The Ocean Health Index (OHI)** project was created with a strong foundation in communication and collaboration. Following the initial publication by [Halpern et al. 2012](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v488/n7413/abs/nature11397.html) in *Nature*, we have conducted annual global assessments to track changes in global ocean health. At the same time, we have been developing the **Ocean Health Index Toolbox** software that will enable others to conduct assessments on their own using the OHI framework. Here, the **Ocean Health Index Manual** describes how to use the Toolbox software.

OHI scores by goal are calculated at the scale of the reporting unit, which is called a **region** and then combined using a weighted average to produce the score for the overall area assessed, called a **study area**. 


## The Ocean Health Index Toolbox

**The Ocean Helath Index Toolbox Application (App)** is open-source software developed to facilitate Index calculations at any scale. The Toolbox App runs using the statistical programming language R and displays input data and calculated scores graphically with maps, histograms, and tables. Goal scores are calculated for each region separately and then combined using a weighted average to produce the score for the overall study area assessed. Modifications can be made to the global studies, allowing calculation of scores with updated data that can then be visualized with the Toolbox App. 

The Toolbox can also be used to calculate scores in smaller-scale **regional assessments** after finer-scale data has been gathered and decisions have been made regarding goal models, pressures and resilience, and reference points. The Toolbox App therefore enables the Ocean Health Index framework to be customized to an area of interest, incorporating the data, indicators, and priorities regarding ocean-derived benefits that are relevant to the chosen area. The App can additionally be used to compare how different management scenarios could affect overall ocean health, which can inform effective strategies for ocean resource management at a local scale.

We recommend first exploring the results from the global assessment and becoming familiar with the Toolbox App before beginning a regional assessment.

**Requirements**: an Internet connection for the initial Toolbox App installation. The Toolbox runs on both a Mac and PC.

1. Install the [latest version of R](http://cran.r-project.org/).
2. Launch the [Toolbox Application](http://ohi-science.org/pages/install.html).
3. Explore global results [using the Toolbox App](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohimanual/blob/master/tutorials/using_the_ohi_toolbox_app.md#using-the-ohi-toolbox-app)
