## Updating your fork

While you've been working on your forked repository locally on your computer, there may be committed updates for the master repository that is 'upstream'. Access these to update your fork. 

To do this on the command line, see [help.github.com](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork). 

To do this through Github:



Once
```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
