## OHI Framework

## OHI Framework - Tailored

## Tailored Framework: Best Practices
- Conceptual planning, model building, and data gathering
- Keep in mind at all times these Best Practices (see [publication](https://peerj.com/articles/1503/) or [Manual](http://ohi-science.org/new-site/manual/#best-practices-for-ohi-assessments)

 ![Best Practices](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1dUFAOVa2JfbKHyaq98yDYdtcDuEPyr10uNB_auz_Pdc/pub?w=768&h=480)

(maybe worth going through each one separately...?)

## Step 1: Define Spatial Boundaries
- Within which all assessments occur
- Judicial boundaries at decision-making scales are preferred

## Step 2: Select Goals and Develop Goal Models 
Ten commonly assessed goals (insert Lauren's figures later)

Conceptual and Practical guidance for each goal (Manual - [Appendix 1](http://ohi-science.org/new-site/manual/#appendix-1-goal-models-reference-points-and-pressure-and-resilience))

  - understand each goal, stick to the definition but think creatively how to represent each goal (Best Practice #1 and #3)
  - how to work different goals together
  - evaluate **reference point, pressures, resilience** while collecting data 
  
 - send data and develop models using templates (Appendix 2 & 3)

## Step 3: Gather Data, Pressure, and Resilience
- [Gather **open-access** data](http://ohi-science.org/new-site/manual/#discovering-and-gathering-input-information) that will be **updated regularly**
- Data for Status, Pressures, and Resilience for each goal
- Use appropriate **temporal and spatial scales**
- High quality data collected by respected organizations under certain protocol
- If can't find ideal data, use **proxy data** or [**gapfill**](http://ohi-science.org/new-site/manual/#gapfilling)


## Tailored Toolbox
Now you have 

- defined spatial boundaries
- developed goal models
- collected data

You can request an **Assessment Repository** and start using the **Toolbox**

- [_Repository_](http://ohi-science.org/new-site/manual/#file-system-organization) is where all the data are stored, managed, and calculations occur
  - Github-based
 
- [_Toolbox_](http://ohi-science.org/new-site/manual/#the-ocean-health-index-toolbox) is the software packages for calculations 
  - Github and R - based
  - open-source

## Step 4: Format, Store, and Register data 

- Toolbox require [specific formats](http://ohi-science.org/new-site/manual/#formatting-data-for-the-toolbox)
  - long formats
  - rescaled to 0-1
- Registered to be called upon during calculation

## Step 5: Modify Goal Models and Calculate Scores

 Calculate: Status, Trend, Pressure, and Resilience
 Report results using template
