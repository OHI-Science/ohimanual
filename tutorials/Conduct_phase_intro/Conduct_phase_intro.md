Tailored Framework: Best Practices
===
You are responsible for Local conceptual planning, model building, and data gathering
To keep in mind at all times

(maybe worth going through each one separately...?)

Step 1: Define Spatial Boundaries
===
Within which all assessments occur. <br />
Judicial boundaries preferred.

Step 2: Select Goals and Develop Goal Models 
===
Ten commonly assessed goals
philosophy and practical guidance for each goal (manual App 1)
  - understand what each goal measures, stick to the definition but think creatively how to represent each goal (Best Practice #1 and #3)
  - how to work different goals together
  - **reference point, pressures, resilience** while collecting data 
 - send data and develop models using templates (App 2 &3?)

Step 3: Gather Data, Pressure, and Resilience 
===
- If can't find ideal data, use **proxy data** and **gapfill** techniques
- Stay true to goal definitions 

Tailored Toolbox: Request a Github Repository
===
Now we have defined spatial boundaries, developed goal models, and collected data... 
Intro to toolbox, what it is, and what it does
Repository is where all the data are stored and calculations occur
Github and R

Step 4: Format, Store, and Register data 
===
Required specific formats
Registered to be called upon during calculation

Step 5: Modify Goal Models and Calculate Scores
===
 Calculate: Status, Trend, Pressure, and Resilience
 Report results using template
