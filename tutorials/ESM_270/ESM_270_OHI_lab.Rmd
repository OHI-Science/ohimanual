# Introduction

The Ocean Health Index [intro here]

Intro to WebApps concept and overview of lab exercise
 - study areas and regions

# Setup Instructions

You access an existing WebApp and modify it locally on your computer to complete the assignment. You will need to install R (and preferably RStudio) to complete the assignment. 

**Setup steps:**

1. Create a folder called `**github**` in your home directory so that the R scripts will run smoothly. This folder will have the following filepath:
    - **Windows**: `Users\[User]\Documents\github\`
    - **Mac**: `Users/[User]/github/`

2. **R**: Download and install the current version of R from [cran.r-project.org](http://cran.r-project.org/). 

3. **RStudio**: Download and install the current version of RStudio from [rstudio.com](www.rstudio.com). 

4. Choose a coastal country or territory that has a WebApp using the list available at [ohi-science.org/subcountry](). The WebApp you choose must have a green `build | passing` indicator associated with its study area. 
    - click the three-letter key (`xxx`) in the '*Repo*' column to explore the WebApp of that study area. 
    - click the date in the '*Last Mod*' column to explore the GitHub repository of that study area. 

5. Click the '*Download ZIP*' button on the main page of the repository for your key (github.com/OHI-Science/`xxx`)

    - NOTE: please do not choose CHN, as it is under development. 

6. Unzip the downloaded ** *.zip* ** folder and save in your `github` folder, removing the `-draft` from the folder's name so that it is simply `xxx`
  
7. Double-click the `.Rproj` file to open **RStudio**, and then follow the instructions below. Note that anything following the `#` symbol in R is a comment providing description or instruction and will not be executed by R.

# Lab Instructions 

**L1. Type the following in the Console window, replacing 'xxx' with your 3-letter code:**

```
key = 'xxx'  # don't forget the quotes!
```

**L2. paste the following into the Console window:**

```

# set the working directory
wd = (sprintf('~/github/%s/subcountry2014', key))
setwd(wd)

# install OHI Toolbox software
source(file.path(wd, 'install_ohicore.r'))

# save a copy of the original calculated scores
file.copy('scores.csv', 'scores_orig.csv')

```

**L3. Explore assessment inputs.**  

Use the WebApp at `http://ohi-science.org/xxx/app/` (replacing *xxx* with your key) to explore the input layers that contribute to each goal. Do this by selecting 'Input Layer' as the variable type and changing the targets. Input layers are identified in the third pull-down menu by title and by the layername (in parentheses).    

Determine which goals you would like to modify, and write them down below in the `.Rmd` version of this document.

## Assignment

A1. 

```{r}
# A1 goal to modify

# write the name of the goal to modify: __________

layerA1 = 'layer_name_here.csv' # write the layername



# Using layers.csv, 


file_save = 'scores_A1.csv' # you can change this filename if you'd like

```






With Excel, open `subcountry2014/layers.csv` to explore which data layers contribute to the goals. 




```
# v source(file.path(wd, 'calculate_scores.r'))


```
