# Introduction to OHI Regional Assessments

Assessments using the OHI framework can be most relevant to policy and management decisions when they are conducted at smaller spatial scales (e.g., countries, states, provinces, ecoregions, bays, etc.). Using ten criteria (called goals), the Index scores on a scale of 0 to 100 how well coastal regions optimize their potential ocean benefits and services in a sustainable way relative to self-established reference points (targets). Relevant goal models are developed based on the best available information, which can be either raw data or composite data, or previously developed indicators.  

**The process of conducting an OHI assessment is as valuable as the final results.** This is because while conducting an OHI assessment you will identify gaps in knowledge and data, produce decision-relevant information, and create an ocean alliance that combines knowledge and cultural values across disciplines. Conducting an OHI assessment requires engagement from as many different groups as possible, including research institutions, government agencies, policy groups, non-governmental organizations, and the civil and private sectors.  

Assessments can incorporate higher-resolution data and indicators, local priorities and preferences, and develop tailored goal models and reference points, which produce scores that better reflect local realities. If a goal is not relevant in the local context, it can be excluded entirely. Similarly, pressures and resilience measures can be refined using local data and indicators. Index scores are only as good as the data on which they are based. **Finding the best data and indicators available is crucial for obtaining meaningful findings that can help inform decision-making.**  

OHI assessments most often involve several **regions** within an overall **study area**. For example, in the global assessment, there were 221 regions (nations and territories) within the study area (global coastal oceans).

Goal scores are calculated for each region separately and then combined to produce an overall Index score for the region. Index scores are combined using an area-weighted average to produce the Index score for the overall study area.
