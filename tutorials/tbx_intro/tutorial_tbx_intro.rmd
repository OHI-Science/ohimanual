## Outline

* Introduction to WebApps
* Explore an Assessment Repository


## Introduction to WebApps

Let's look at an example for Belize: http://ohi-science.org/blz.

WebApp tabs: 

* [App](http://ohi-science.org/blz/app): interactive to explore data and scores
* [Regions](http://ohi-science.org/blz/regions/): Belize has 4
* [Layers](http://ohi-science.org/blz/layers/): alphabetical list of all data
* [Goals](http://ohi-science.org/blz/goals/): global goal model equations
* [Scores](http://ohi-science.org/blz/scores/): calculated based on extracted global data


## Explore an Assessment Repository

Belize's **assessment repository** is **blz**, available on GitHub at https://github.com/OHI-Science/blz.  
  
The **scenario folder** is **subcountry2014**. 

Note the `blz.Rproj` file that allows you to sync this repository through RStudio.

## Explore an Assessment Repository

Within the **subcountry2014** folder are some key files we will work with:

* **layers.csv**
* **layers folder**
* **conf/functions.r**
* **conf/goals.csv**
* **conf/pressures_matrix.csv**
* **conf/resilience_matrix.csv**
