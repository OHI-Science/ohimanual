## Introduction

The [**Ocean Health Index (OHI)**](www.oceanhealthindex.org) measures the sustainable delivery of ten ‘goals’ (key benefits and services) to people now and in the future. At any spatial scale, OHI assessments use the best available information to develop goal models and set targets, and goal scores are combined together to give a comprehensive picture of coastal ocean health.  

**The OHI Toolbox** is an open-source, cross-platform resource to calculate OHI scores at any scale. Here, we will explore the Toolbox. We will use Belize as an example: this is for teaching purposes only.

## What is the Toolbox?

The **OHI Toolbox** is an ecosystem of data, scripts, and structure used to facilitate the highly collaborative OHI assessment process at any scale. We interact with the Toolbox through a few repositories stored on GitHub. Data are fed to the Toolbox as *.csv* files, and all scripts are in *R*.

You will have an assessment repository that contains all data and functions, pressures + resilience matices, and other goodies. So,

Any assessment relies on the `ohicore` repository. But there is also an additional repository specific to the assessment, which contains all the prepped data and functions, pressures + resilience matices, and other goodies. So,

## Introduction to WebApps

Let's look at an example for Belize: http://ohi-science.org/blz.

WebApp tabs: 

* [App](http://ohi-science.org/blz/app): interactive to explore data and scores
* [Regions](http://ohi-science.org/blz/regions/): Belize has 4
* [Layers](http://ohi-science.org/blz/layers/): alphabetical list of all data
* [Goals](http://ohi-science.org/blz/goals/): global goal model equations
* [Scores](http://ohi-science.org/blz/scores/): calculated based on extracted global data


## Explore an Assessment Repository

Belize's **assessment repository** is **blz**, available on GitHub at https://github.com/OHI-Science/blz.  
  
The **scenario folder** is **subcountry2014**. 

Note the `blz.Rproj` file that allows you to sync this repository through RStudio.

## Explore an Assessment Repository

Within the **subcountry2014** folder are some key files we will work with:

* **layers.csv**
* **layers folder**
* **conf/functions.r**
* **conf/goals.csv**
* **conf/pressures_matrix.csv**
* **conf/resilience_matrix.csv**
