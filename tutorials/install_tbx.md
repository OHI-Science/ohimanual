# Installing the Toolbox for a Regional Assessment 

## Getting started
OHI Toolbox software is written in R, and work with simple *.csv* files to store data and registeries. Template files and scripts are kept together in a folder, a **GitHub repository**, online. GitHub is an open-source development platform that enables easy collaboration and versioning (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub).

At this point, you should already be familiar with your repository's filesystem (see Section 4.5 above). To efficiently modify input data files, set parameters and modify goals, you will need to download your repository onto your computer. In GitHub vocabulary, this is called to 'clone' your repository. This will put a complete copy of the repository on your computer, enabling you to work offline.

We recommend establishing a GitHub user account, which will allow you to syncronize your modifications with the online repository. Your website (accessed from [ohi-science.org](http://ohi-science.org)) will also display these modifications visually. Using GitHub faciliates collaboration within your team and also allows us to provide support when you need it. However, it is possible to work independently without GitHub (after the initial download), although you will not be able to synchronize your work with your website, and we cannot offer much support in this case.
