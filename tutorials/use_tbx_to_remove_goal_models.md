## Removing goals
If a goal is not relevant in your region, it is possible to remove the goal completely from the calculation. There are four places where you will need to remove the reference to this goal:

1. `functions.r`
2. `goals.csv`
3. `pressures_matrix.csv`
4. `resilience_matrix.csv`

![*Failing to delete all referenced layers after the goal is deleted will prompt a number of error messages.*](./fig/remove_goal.png)

**Example: Removing carbon storage (CS) goal**

1) Remove the carbon storage (CS) goal model from `functions.r`:

2) Remove the CS row from `goals.csv`:

3) Remove all CS rows from `pressures_matrix.csv`:

4) Remove all CS rows from `resilience_matrix.csv`:
