While you've been working on your forked repository locally on your computer (ex: `remi-daigle/ohi-global`), there may be committed updates in the owner's repository that is 'upstream' (ex: `OHI-Science/ohi-global`). To ensure that you are working with the most updated repository, you need to update your fork by creating a **pull request**. 

To do this on the command line, see [help.github.com](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork).  

To do this through Github:

#

1. Go to the repository ('repo') belonging to the project owner 'upstream'. In this example, the owner is called `OHI-Science` and the repo is `ohi-global`. Note that there are recent updates by user Melsteroni. To pull the most recent version of `ohi-global` from `OHI-Science`, click on the green button.

2. You will need to sync forks (the default is to sync branches).

3. Change the base fork to your repo: in this example it is `remi-daigle\ohi-global`. The head fork is the owner's repo: `OHI-Science\ohi-global`. You can see those most recent commits by Melsteroni. Now you can click 'Create pull request'.

**Note:** 

- when the base fork and head fork are identified, we are in the forked repo `remi-daigle/ohi-global'. It is also possible to create a pull request the the head fork from this location.  

- if that if you get an error *There isn't anything to compare*, make sure you are still comparing forks, not branches.

4. Enter a Title and a comment, when then allows you to click *Create pull request*
