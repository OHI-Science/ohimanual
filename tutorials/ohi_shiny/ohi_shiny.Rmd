## Ocean Health Index

- setup:
  - prelaunch in new tab: http://ohi-science.nceas.ucsb.edu/bhi
  - add: `?presentme=true` to URL, click `p` for notes
- The Ocean Health Index is a way to measure ocean health at **local, regional, national and global** scales. 
- The Index uses data from multiple ocean-related activities and services including fishing, tourism, and clean waters to name a few.
- Began as an academic exercise - UCSB/NCEAS and Conservation International, now being adopted by governments around the world to inform how they measure and manage for the health of their oceans (*this could be transition sentence to the map*). The UN is in the process of adopting OHI principles.
- It provides a high level view for policy makers, while enabling deep inspection by analysts. This reductionist approach appeals to a very wide audience.
- And Shiny has proven an excellent tool to enable this interactive view of the data.

JA: *Thinking that while this is up on the screen, we can talk about how we developed a shiny app to enable users in Colombia, Ecuador, Baltic (name drop a few cool ones) to do their own assessment and effectively communicate their results directly to policy makers. Really get people excited about how Shiny is directly helping people improve the health of our oceans...something along those lines!*

<div class="notes">
- The OHI Shiny app enables interactive visualization of output scores and input layers. Each of these can be visualized across these **tabs**: spatially "Map" tab, or as a ["Histogram"] or ["Table"].
- We can [**zoom, pan and hover**] to see specific values with the interactive map. 
- We can also dive into the hierarchical elements of OHI. The **dropdowns** on the left are conditional based on the selections above, whether looking at "Output Scores"" or ["Input Layers"] and the sub-elements therein.
- The app syncs with the **Github** repository having branches for draft vs published stages of data. Travis continuous integration checks the draft data commits for any errors and if none, continues to update the published branch and static outputs like figures and tables on the gh-pages website branch.

## Next Steps for OHI Shiny Dev

> 1. Migrate custom [`rCharts`](https://github.com/OHI-Science/rCharts) &rarr; [`leaflet`](http://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/)
>
> 1. Add [source layers](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/globalmarine), eg 1km raster shipping (leaflet::[addRaster, tileOptions](https://github.com/rstudio/leaflet/blob/7631cfa1404d54bcb0f4dc813e775bdc1af0d584/R/layers.R#L114-L219))<br>

> 1. Embed [interactive flower plot](http://bl.ocks.org/bbest/2de0e25d4840c68f2db1) on map rollover<br>

<div class="notes">
- The original app was developed with Ramnath's **rCharts** package. The RStudio **leaflet** package has since become available and offers some appealing new features to motivate migration, including use of **TopoJSON** for smaller storage and faster loading. 
- A common misunderstanding about OHI is that it's a "crude" assessment of ocean health from looking at the initial global study. However the spatial crudeness is based upon the underlying layers and the user chosen spatial units to which the layers get aggregated, whether at a country, state or even county level. In keeping with the hierarchical reductionist theme and to make the input layer values even more transparent, we want to make all input layers in their original spatial units visible, whether vector or raster. Many of these pressure layers, for instance, are based on 1 km global rasters. We hope to integrate raster tiling, a feature in development with the leaflet package, to show these and other original input data layers at the finest possible scale to fully communicate the strengths and weaknesses of the raw data.
- Finally, we've found the flower plot to be a very effective visualization to communicate results. We've developed a D3 implementation of this which we'll make appear in the upper right for on hover events of the map when looking at the default output scores.
