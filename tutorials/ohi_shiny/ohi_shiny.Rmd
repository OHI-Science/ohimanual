- The Ocean Health Index is a way to measure ocean health at local, regional, national and global scales. 
- The Index uses data from multiple ocean-related activities and services including fishing, tourism, and clean waters to name a few.
- Began as an academic exercise - UCSB/NCEAS and Conservation International, now being adopted by governments around the world to inform how they measure and manage for the health of their oceans (*this could be transition sentence to the map*).

JA: *Thinking that while this is up on the screen, we can talk about how we developed a shiny app to enable users in Colombia, Ecuador, Baltic (name drop a few cool ones) to do their own assessment and effectively communicate their results directly to policy makers. Really get people excited about how Shiny is directly helping people improve the health of our oceans...something along those lines!*
