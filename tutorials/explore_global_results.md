# Explore Global Results with the Toolbox App

The following section will be devoted to exploring the Ocean Health Index Global Results using the Toolbox App. The section will further familiarize the user with the organizational structure and functionality of the Toolbox, and will also help the user understand the results that were obtained in the global assessment,  including the types of data that were used to calculate the Ocean Health Index.

To begin exploring results, the user must first select (from the drop-down menus) the data that they wish to display with the Toolbox (i.e. variable type > target > dimension/layer > category > year).

**For example:**

> **Output Score > Fisheries (FIS) > score**
shows the final calculated score for the fisheries sub-goal in the current scenario (2013).

> **Input Layer > Mariculture > Mariculture species harvested**
shows the different harvested species that were used to calculate the mariculture sub-goal in the current scenario (2013).

As mentioned previously, the selected data can then be viewed as a Map, as a distribution on the Histogram tab or numerically in Table form.

## Map 

Suppose for instance that **Output Score > Index > score** is selected and viewed as a map (default selection).

The target (Index) and dimension (Score) chosen from the drop-down menu is displayed as text on the top right corner of the map. Below this information, the region name, (region number), and value appear if the user’s mouse hovers over a specific region. When the value of that region is displayed, the region will darken on the map. If the mouse is not indicating a specific region, this area will instruct to ‘hover over a region’. Zooming in and out of the map is possible with the plus/minus in the upper left of the map. A color legend is also displayed in the lower right corner of the map that provides a linear colormap of the data. The range of values will change as different variables are selected.

## Histogram

For example, if the **Output Score > Fisheries > score** sub-goal is selected, the histogram shows the frequency of each fisheries score:

As noted in the figure above, the Histogram view allows the user to see the range of scores (lowest and highest) as well as the frequency of each (most vs. least common). The latter may be helpful for instance if the user wishes to compare to score of a particular country to all the other scores.

## Table

The table displays the target value for each region and the overall study area, with an identifying code (rgn_id), name (rgn_name), and value (value) for each. The Table view can be especially useful in quickly finding values for a particular country, given that the user can easily navigate the OHI data using the search bar located on the upper right of the table (caps-sensitive).

It is also possible to search within individual columns by entering the search term at the bottom of each column; this option is more easily displayed by changing the number of records per page to 10 using the drop-down menu. Data may also be sorted the arrows at the left of each column name. Sorting by rgn_id is the default.
