# Explore Global Results with the Toolbox App

The following section will be devoted to exploring the global results in the toolbox as a way to further familiarize the user with the organizational structure and functionality of the Toolbox.

The section will also describe some of the results of the global assessment as well on the types of data used to calculate the Ocean Health Index.

To begin exploring results, the user must select the data he wishes to display with the Toolbox (i.e. variable type > target > dimension/layer > category > year).

**For example:**

> **Output Score > Fisheries (FIS) > score**
shows the final calculated score for the fisheries sub-goal in the current scenario (2013).

> **Input Layer > Mariculture > Mariculture species harvested**
shows the different harvested species that were used to calculate the mariculture sub-goal in the current scenario (2013).

As mentioned previously, the selected data can then be viewed as a map, as a distribution on the Histogram tab or numerically in Table form.
