# Ocean Health Index Regional Assessments

**Regional assessments** use the Ocean Health Index framework to study smaller spatial scales, often where policy and management decisions are made. Scores by goal are calculated for each *region*, and regions are combined using a weighted average to produce the score for the overall area assessed, called a *study area*. In regional assessments, coastal states or provinces are often the *regions* within a country, which is the *study area*.

Regional assessments incorporate local priorities, higher-resolution data and indicators, and use tailored goal models and reference points, which produce scores better reflecting local realities. Regional assessments have been published in peer-review journals for the U.S. West Coast and for Brazil, and more are underway.   

## Conducting a regional assessment

Regional assessments require a qualified team to tailor the Ocean Health Index for the study area; there are many decisions to make and data to gather from disparate sources. The Toolbox can be used to do all of the calculations for the assessment, but it is only after all other items have been accomplished:

+ decisions have been made about which goal models to include and/or modify
+ data are collected and properly formatted
+ reference points have been decided

Using the Toolbox is only about 20% of the work involved in conducting a regional assessment.

## Getting Started

Ocean Health Index assessments have a specific organization of data files, registry files, and R scripts that work together to do calculations and present the final scores graphically. These files and scripts are packaged together in a folder called a **repository**. Each Ocean Health Index assessment has its own repository. Repositories are stored online through GitHub, which enables easy collaboration with versioning capabilities. [Learn more about GitHub repositories and OHI]((https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohimanual/blob/master/tutorials/github_repos.md#github-repositories)).

It is possible to conduct a regional assessment by downloading a template repository from GitHub. We recommend having a GitHub user account and syncing with the online repository: this faciliates collaboration within your team but also allows us to provide support when you need it. However, it is possible to work independently without GitHub (after the initial download), although we cannot offer much support in this case.
