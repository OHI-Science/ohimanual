# Conducting a Regional Assessment

## What to expect when conducting a regional assessment

There are key considerations and processes that will be a part of every regional assessment, however, how each regional assessment is conducted will be unique depending on the local context. For example: what data and indicators are available will determine how goal models are able to be tailored to the region, and what skillsets and resources are involved will affect the time it takes to complete the assessment. 

### Timeline 

The time required to complete a regional assessment depends on the local context and available resources, but the proportion of time required for different phases of the assessment is more predictable.  

**Expect for strategic planning, discovering and gathering data, and developing reference points and models, to comprise > 80% of the time allotted for the regional assessment**.

## What is provided  

The Ocean Health Index Toolbox can be used to calculate scores for regional assessments. When you begin a regional assessment, you will be provided with a **repository**: a set of Toolbox files and software scripts specific to your study area. The data in the files provided serve as a template: they are the data used in the global assessments, extracted for your study area. These data files will need to be updated with locally available data and indicators so as to give a more fine-scale assessment of ocean health in your study area. However, if better data are not available, it is possible to use the files provided.  

Our team of scientists and managers is prepared to provide guidance for regional assessments, from initial meetings to discussions about model development to disseminating results.

## Points to remember

We recommend to remember the following as you develop your approach:

* People are part of ocean health
    + economic and social data are included, and certain terrestrial data near the coast
* Document all decisions made
    + document data sources, urls, date of access, reference points set, why models were modified the way they were (and not other potential ways)...
    + important for transparency, describing methods and explaining results in reports and publications, and for reproducibility (for any future comparable assessments in your study area)
* Goal models should be modified to capture local characteristics and priorities of the region
    + how goal models are developed depends on what is important locally and what data/indicators are available.
* Assessments can use a mixture of regional-, country- and global-scale data   
* Scores are calculated by region
    + comparing scores between subcountry regions is a main reason of conducting a regional assessment
    + regional scores are combined by weighted average to calculate scores for the study area
    + goal models are the same across all regions; data are specific to the region. For example, the carbon storage goal model is calculated in the same way for each region, but which habitats are present in each region, and the area and condition of those habitats are specific to each region
* All data do not need to be at the same spatial or temporal scale
    + each assessment should represent the best understanding of ocean health at the point in time. For example if fisheries data are available from 1980-2011 and tourism from 2008-2012; these can be used together to calculate Index scores, which will be the representation of current ocean health


## Checklist: To Do Before Using the Toolbox

Most of the time spent while conducting a regional assessment occurs before using the Toolbox, although being familiar with the Toolbox's composition and structure can help guide you. The following will not be checked-off in sequence: there is a lot of back and forth as you discover data, develop reference points and models, revisit other data possibilities.  

Here is a checklist of decisions and steps that must be done before the Toolbox can calculate regional goal scores:

* Understand the philosophy of the Ocean Health Index
    + understand what goals represent and how they are modeled 
    + understand what pressures and resilience are included 
    + understand how reference points are set
* Identify local characteristics and priorities
    + should any goals be removed?
    + should any goals be redefined?
    + should other goals be added?
    + should goals be weighted unequally? 
    + what are pressures to the local system?
    + what resilience measures (laws, regulations) are in place locally?
    + what local cultural preferences or priorities should be captured in the assessment? 
* Decide the spatial scale for regions within the study area 
    + we recommend multiple regions
    + regions within the study area should be at the smallest scale the data allow
    + in what spatial scale are data most frequently reported?
    + in what spatial scale are policy decisions made (optional)?
* Be familiar with the global inputs to your Toolbox repository
    + understand the data and models used in global assessments
    + prioritize which data and models should be updated 
    + become familiar with the Toolbox framework for your study region
      - example: ohi-science.org/ecu
* Discover and gather appropriate data and indicators
    + what local data and indicators are available for goal models?
    + what local data and indicators are available pressures and resilience?
    + how would reference points be set for local data?
    + do local data and indicators capture the philosophy of the Ocean Health Index?
    + are local data and indicators at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales?
    + process and format data and indicators to create data layers* for the Toolbox
    + use the Toolbox repository as a registry to organize data layers
* Update pressures and resilience
    + determine whether all global pressures are relevant locally
    + identify local pressures not captured in the pressures matrix
    + categorize any new pressures layers
    + set pressure weighting/ranking based on literature, expert opinion
    + identify responsive resilience measures
    + categorize any new resilience layers
* Modify goal models and set reference points:
    + can goal models be refined using locally available data and indicators?
    + can reference points be refined using locally available data and indicators?
    
    
\* Each data component that is included in the OHI is called a **data layer** because it will be combined with others to create the most complete picture of ocean health. Many data layers are rescaled from 0-1 to be combined with others on the same unitless scale.
