# Conducting a Regional Assessment

**Calculating Ocean Health Index scores at regional scales requires engagement from as many different groups as possible, including research institutions, government agencies, policy groups, non-governmental organizations, and the civil and private sectors.** The process for developing a regional assessment can be as valuable as the final calculated scores, since it creates an ocean alliance that combines knowledge and cultural values from many different perspectives and disciplines. The Ocean Health Index framework is flexible to accommodate regional priorities: goal models can be modified to incorporate the best available local data and indicators, or excluded entirely to best represent regional attributes.

## What to expect when conducting a regional assessment

What is involved when conducting a regional assessment of the Ocean Health Index will depend on the local context, for example: what data and indicators are available, how many people are involved, and what resources are available. How long a regional assessment takes to complete will depend on these variables. 

### Timing and funding
While the time required to complete depends on the local context, the proportion of time required for different phases of the assessment is more predictable. **Expect for decision-making, discovering, gathering, and formatting data, setting reference points, and developing models to take > 80% of the time involved**.

Regional assessments can be completed at varying costs depending on the local context. Funds are needed for a management and scientific team, workshops and meetings (including travel), communications, policy engagement, and operating costs. Therefore, securing funding is an important component to satisfactorily complete the assessment. We encourage the development of a local proposal or strategic action plan that details a timeline of activities and the resources needed to accomplish them.

### Assembling a qualified team
Given the multidisciplinary nature of the Index, the team conducting a regional assessment will require members with specific skills, including:

* having broad scientific understanding and experience with environmental policy
* being comfortable with handling large data sets, making decisions, and thinking creatively
* working with ArcGIS or other spatial analysis software
* working with the software program R and user-created packages
* collaborating well in a multidisciplinary team, remotely and in person
  
### What is provided  
When you begin a regional assessment, you will be provided with a set of files and software scripts for running the Toolbox in your study area. The Toolbox can be used to do all of the calculations for the assessment, but the data files will need to be updated with locally available data and indicators. The data in the files provided serve as a template: they are the data used in the global assessments, extracted for your study area. The purpose of conducting a regional assessment is to use more fine-scale data, therefore, you will replace as much of these data files as possible throughout your assessment. However, if better data are not available, it is possible to use the files provided.  

Additionally, our team of scientists and managers is prepared to provide guidance for regional assessments, from initial meetings to discussions about model development to disseminating results.

## To Do Before Using the Toolbox

Most of the time spent while conducting a regional assessment occurs before using the Toolbox. Regional assessments require a qualified team with diverse skill sets: there are many decisions to make and data to gather from disparate sources. Here is a checklist of decisions and steps that must be done:
    
**Checklist to complete before using the Toolbox:**

* Understand the philosophy of the Ocean Health Index
    + understand what goals represent and how they are modeled   
    + understand how reference points are set
* Decide which goals to include
    + should any goals be removed?
    + should any goals be redefined?
    + should others be added?    
    + should goals be weighted unequally? What evidence/opinion supports this?
* Identify local characteristics and priorities
    + what are pressures to the local system?
    + what resilience measures (laws, regulations) are in place?
    + what local cultural preferences or priorities should be captured in the assessment? 
* Decide the spatial scale for regions within the study area
    + in what spatial scale are data most frequently reported?
    + in what spatial scale are policy decisions made (optional)?
* Discover and gather appropriate data and indicators
    + what local data and indicators are available for goal models?
    + what local data and indicators are available pressures and resilience?
    + how would reference points be set for local data?
    + do local data and indicators capture the philosophy of the Ocean Health Index?
    + are local data and indicators at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales?
* Modify goal models:
    + can goal goal models be refined using locally available data and indicators?
* Process and format data and indicators
    + create data layers* for the Toolbox
    
    
\* Each data component that is included in the OHI is called a **data layer** because it will be combined with others to create the most complete picture of ocean health. Many data layers are rescaled from 0-1 to be combined with others on the same unitless scale.
