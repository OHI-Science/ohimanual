# Conducting a Regional Assessment

What does conducting a regional assessment mean?

Most time spent before using the Toolbox. Here is a checklist of things that must be done. 

Task Timeline.

Regional assessments require a qualified team to tailor the Ocean Health Index for the study area; there are many decisions to make and data to gather from disparate sources. The Toolbox can be used to do all of the calculations for the assessment, but it is only after all other items have been accomplished:

+ decisions have been made about which goal models to include and/or modify
+ data are collected and properly formatted
+ reference points have been decided

Using the Toolbox is only about 20% of the work involved in conducting a regional assessment.
