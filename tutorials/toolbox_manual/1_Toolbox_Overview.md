# The Ocean Health Index Toolbox Manual



## The Ocean Health Index Toolbox 
**The OHI Toolbox** Application (App) was developed for exploration of global OHI scores and to facilitate regional assessments. The Toolbox is displayed through a web browser and runs using the statistical programming language **R**. The Toolbox takes input data and calculates goal scores for each region and combines the regions using a weighted average to produce the score for the overall study area assessed. Input data and calculated scores are displayed graphically with maps, histograms, and tables.

## Getting Started
  
We recommend exploring the results from the global assessment and becoming familiar with the Toolbox App before beginning a regional assessment.  
  
### Exploring the results from the global assessment:

Following initial installation, the Toolbox does not require an Internet connection and exploration using the Toolbox App is possible offline. 

**Requirements**: familiarity with the Toolbox application

1. Install the [latest version of R](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohimanual/blob/master/tutorials/required_software/software_for_OHI.md#required-software).
2. Install the [OHI Toolbox](http://ohi-science.org/pages/install.html).
3. Become familiar [using the Toolbox App](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohimanual/blob/master/tutorials/toolbox_manual%20PO/Step_3_Using_the_OHI_Toolbox_App.md)

### Conducting a regional assessment:

Following initial installation, the Toolbox does not require an Internet connection. New data can be incorporated into the file system and goal models can be modified allowing calculation of scores with updated data and visualized with the Toolbox App. However, conducting a regional assessment using GitHub (recommended) does require frequent access to the Internet.

**Requirements**: familiarity with the Toolbox application and proficiency with data management and the coding language **R** (See: other [R resources](http://ohi-science.org/pages/learning_r.html)). Proficiency in spatial software such as ArcGIS may also be required, depending on the regional assessment strategy. 

1. Install the [latest version of R](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohimanual/blob/master/tutorials/required_software/software_for_OHI.md#required-software).
2. Install the OHI Toolbox by [accessing a regional assessment repository](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohimanual/blob/master/tutorials/accessing_a_repo/accessing_a_repo.md#accessing-github-repositories)
3. Become familiar with the [File System](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohimanual/blob/master/tutorials/toolbox_manual%20PO/Step_4_File_system.md)
4. Calculate [regional assessment scores](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohimanual/blob/master/tutorials/toolbox_manual%20PO/calculate_regional_assessment_scores.md)
