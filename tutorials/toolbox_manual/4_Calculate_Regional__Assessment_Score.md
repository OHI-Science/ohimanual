# Calculate regional assessment scores

\*\* **Note: this page is under development**

It is at this point that it is possible to incorporate all of the decisions your team has made into the OHI framework:

* Goals:
    + which goals to include? 
    + how will the goals be weighted?
* Spatial scale:
    + what are the regions within the study area?
* Data:  
    + which data layers can be updated?
    + which data layers must be changed to develop new goal models?
* Goal models:
    + develop any goal models with the best available data
    
Understanding how the Toolbox is structured can help identify what must be modified for a regional assessemt, particularly with data and models.      

## Modifying and registering data layers
Become familiar with the layers that are included in the global OHI assessment. Each data layer is saved as a separate *.csv* file in the `layers` folder.
