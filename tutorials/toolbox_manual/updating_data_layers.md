# Updating Data Layers


## Folder location
The default data layers to be modified for the regional assessment are located in the layers folder (as shown for the China assessment below), and each data layer is saved as a separate .csv file.

## Modifying data
New data layers will be added, and old layers modified directly in the folder:

### 1. Saving new layers

For example, the fisheries goal uses a B/Bmsy ratio for every species within an FAO region on a particular year to assess the sustainability of the fishery. 
If the B/Bmsy ratio for a local population was known however, the FAO average could be directly replaced with the finer resolution number.

### 2. Registering layers
