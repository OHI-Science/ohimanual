It is at this point possible to incorporate all of the decisions your team has made into the OHI framework.

You may want to learn how to appropriately [gather](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohimanual/blob/master/tutorials/toolbox_manual/gathering_appropriate_data.md#gathering-appropriate-data) and [format](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohimanual/blob/master/tutorials/toolbox_manual/formatting_data_for_toolbox.xlsx) the data prior to starting.

In general, understanding how the Toolbox is structured can help identify what must be modified for a regional assessement, particularly with data and models.

## Overview

  1.  Modifying existing data layers
  
  2.  Creating new data layers

  3.  Registering the layers

  4.  Updating goal models

  5.  Register goal inputs 

  6.  Check (and update when appropriate) pressures_matrix.csv and resilience_matrix.csv


## Modifying existing data layers
The default data layers to be modified for the regional assessment are located in the layers folder (as shown for the China assessment below), and each data layer is saved as a separate *.csv* file in the `layers` folder.

![alt text](zfig_layers_location_1.png)

New data layers will be added, and old layers modified directly in this folder.

Suppose for instance that finer resolution data becomes available for the fisheries sub-goal during a regional evaluation; for example an improved B/Bmsy ratio for the 'Ablennes hians' species that was obtained through formal stock assessments and complex models developed for data-rich fisheries. The old ratios derived from the latest global assessment, say 1.03 in 2008 could then be replaced  with the new ratio, and the new score subsequently calculated.

## Creating new data layers
Suppose however that the methodology for a particular data layer needs to be modified, rather than data points just being updated as in the example above with the B/Bmsy ratio. In that case, a new data layer must be created, registered, and then updated the relevant goal models and pressure/resilience matrices.

  * To create a new data layer, simply create a new csv file in the layers folder, add the relevant data points, and save the file.

  * In this case, additional 'access' data for the artisanal opportunities goal was added for each of the regions.

## Registering new data layers
Once the new data has been introduced into the appropriate layer file, it has to be registered as a new row in the layers.csv registry, which manages all the data that the Toolbox App uses:

![alt text](zfig_layers_csv.png)

Add a new row in the registry for the new data layer (example is highlighted in yellow), and fill in the first eight columns (columns A-H) as described below; other columns are generated later by the Toolbox App as it confirms data formatting and content.  

![alt text](zfig_new_layer.png)

 + **targets:** Add the the goal/dimension that the new data layer relates to. Goals are indicated with two-letter codes and sub-goals are indicated with three-letter codes, with pressures, resilience, and spatial layers indicated separately
 + **layer:** Add an identifying name for the new data layer, which will be used in R scripts like functions.R and .csv files like pressures_matrix.csv and resilience_matrix.csv.
 + **name:** Add a longer title for the data layer.
 + **description:** Add a longer description of the new data layer.
 + **fld_value:** indicates the units along with the units column.
 + **units:** importantly describes which field (column header) is the value from the data layer.
 + **filename:** Add a filename for the new data layer that matches the name of the csv file that was created previously in the 'layers' folder.
 + **fld_id_num:** XXXXXXXXXXXXX.
