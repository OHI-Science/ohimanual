# Introduction to OHI Regional Assessments

Regional assessments use the Ocean Health Index (OHI) framework to study smaller spatial scales (e.g. countries, states, provinces, ecoregions, bays, etc.), where policy and management decisions are made. Using ten criteria (called goals), the Index scores on a scale of 0 to 100 how well coastal regions optimize their potential ocean benefits and services in a sustainable way relative to self-established reference points (targets). Regional assessments incorporate local priorities and preferences, higher-resolution data and indicators, and use tailored goal models and reference points, which produce scores that better reflect local realities. OHI is designed to combine and complement existing efforts to produce a comprehensive assessment of ocean health. And, because the assessments are developed at the scale of decision-making using local data and parameters, the findings can help inform decision-making and management actions aimed at maximizing sustainable productivity while preserving vital natural capital.  

Each goal score is combined into a weighted average to produce the score for the overall area assessed, called a **study area**. In regional assessments, coastal states or provinces are often the **regions** within the **study area**.

The Ocean Health Index framework is flexible to accommodate regional priorities: goal models can be modified to incorporate the best available local data and indicators, or excluded entirely to best represent regional attributes. Similarly, pressures and resilience measures can be refined using local data and indicators. Because OHI is a data driven framework, Index scores are only as 'good' as the data on which they are based, so finding the best data or indicators available is fundamental to obtain meaningful findings that can help inform decision-making. 

**The process for developing a regional assessment is equally valuable as the final calculated scores, since it helps identify knowledge and data gaps, produces decision-relevant information, and creates an ocean alliance that combines knowledge and cultural values from many different perspectives and disciplines**. Calculating Ocean Health Index scores at regional scales requires engagement from as many different groups as possible, including research institutions, government agencies, policy groups, non-governmental organizations, and the civil and private sectors.
  
Regional assessment case studies have been published in peer-review journals for the U.S. West Coast ([Halpern et al. 2014](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0098995)) and for Brazil ([Elfes et al. 2014](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0092589)), and more are underway.   

## Before getting started

Before beginning a regional assessment, it is important to have planned several things:

* Develop strategic plan and timeline
    + determine resources available
    + outline timeline with any meetings and workshops necessary
    + engage management/decision-makers early for results to be most useful
* Assemble a qualified team with diverse skills
    + have a broad scientific understanding and experience with environmental policy
    + are comfortable with handling large data sets, making decisions, and thinking creatively
    + collaborate well in a multidisciplinary team, remotely and in person
    + can work with the software program R and user-created packages (at least one person)
    + can work with ArcGIS or other spatial analysis software (at least one person)
    + are fluent in English (at least one person)
* Funding 
    + greatly depends on the local context
    + potentially needed for a management and scientific team, workshops and meetings (including travel), communications, policy engagement, and operating costs
* Policy and management interest (optional)
    + engage policy makers early: informing government policies to improve ocean health is most effective if there is early interest and engagement from government agencies
    + requires ongoing communication during Index development to best inform management actions that could have measurable impacts. 
    + repeated assessments as new data become available enable tracking ocean health through time and evaluating management and policy interventions
