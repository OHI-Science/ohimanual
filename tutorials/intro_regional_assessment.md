# Introduction to OHI Regional Assessments

**Regional assessments** use the Ocean Health Index framework to study smaller spatial scales, often where policy and management decisions are made. Regional assessments incorporate local priorities, higher-resolution data and indicators, and use tailored goal models and reference points, which produce scores better reflecting local realities.  

Scores by goal are calculated for each **region**, and regions are combined using a weighted average to produce the score for the overall area assessed, called a **study area**. In regional assessments, coastal states or provinces are often the **regions** within a country, which is the **study area**.

Regional assessments have been published in peer-review journals for the U.S. West Coast ([Halpern et al. 2014](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0098995)) and for Brazil ([Elfes et al. 2014](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0092589) ), and more are underway.
