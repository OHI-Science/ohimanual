# Introduction to OHI Regional Assessments

**Regional assessments** use the Ocean Health Index framework to study smaller spatial scales, often where policy and management decisions are made. Scores by goal are calculated for each *region*, and regions are combined using a weighted average to produce the score for the overall area assessed, called a *study area*. In regional assessments, coastal states or provinces are often the *regions* within a country, which is the *study area*.

Regional assessments incorporate local priorities, higher-resolution data and indicators, and use tailored goal models and reference points, which produce scores better reflecting local realities. Regional assessments have been published in peer-review journals for the U.S. West Coast and for Brazil, and more are underway.
