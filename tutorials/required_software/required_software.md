# Required software

The Ocean Health Index works primarily with freely available, open-source software. To work the the Toolbox, there are several software programs you will need to download. 

# Software

### Install the latest version of R
Download [**R**](http://cran.r-project.org/) and install this on your computer. If you already have R installed, check the website for updates. There are frequent updates to the R software, and the current version is identified on the websited. Compare what is available from their wesite with what you already have on your computer by typing `sessionInfo()` into your R console. (This will also identify packages you have installed).

### Install the latest version of RStudio
While not required, we highly recommend working with [**RStudio**](http://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/), which is an interface that makes working with R much easier. RStudio also has great compatibility with GitHub so you can collaborate with your team directly from your R code. RStudio does not get updated as often as R does, but it is good to check for updates regularly.
