# Required software

The Ocean Health Index works primarily with freely available, open-source software. To work the the Toolbox, there are several software programs you will need to download. 

## Software

### Install the latest version of R
Download [**R**](http://cran.r-project.org/) and install this on your computer. If you already have R installed, check the website for updates. There are frequent updates to the R software, and the current version is identified on the websited. Compare what is available from their wesite with what you already have on your computer by typing `sessionInfo()` into your R console. (This will also identify packages you have installed).

### Install the latest version of RStudio
While not required, we highly recommend working with [**RStudio**](http://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/), which is an interface that makes working with R much easier. RStudio also has great compatibility with GitHub so you can collaborate with your team directly from your R code. RStudio does not get updated as often as R does, but it is good to check for updates regularly. 

### Rmarkdown
[Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is a powerful way to track progress as you use the Toolbox to reflect the characteristics and priorities in your study region. Here are some [Rmarkdown tips](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohimanual/blob/master/tutorials/Rmarkdown_tips/Rmarkdown_tips.md#rmarkdown-tips).
