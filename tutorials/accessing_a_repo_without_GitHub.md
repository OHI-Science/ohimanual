## Accessing repositories without GitHub

### OHI regional assessments without GitHub
It is possible to conduct a regional assessment without having a GitHub account. You can do a one-time download from the GitHub repository and then work locally on your computer without syncing to the GitHub server. We do not recommend this because it is more difficult for you to track progress and decisions, and for us to help or advise you. We recommend accessing a repository with GitHub but provide instructions here of how to access a repository without Github. We can always get your filesystem onto GitHub later. 


### Download the repo to your computer
Contact the OHI team (bbest@nceas.ucsb.edu or lowndes@nceas.ucsb.edu) to create a repository for your group. The repository will be stored on github.com and called `OHI-Science/[assessment]`: for example, `github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-israel`.
When your repository has been created, enter the url in to an internet browser (for example, `github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-israel`). Click `Download ZIP`.

### Working locally

Unzip the downloaded folder `[assessment]-master` and save the folder on your computer. We recommend creating a folder called `github` in your root directory and saving your repository to this file path: `~/github/[assessment]`. This will make collaborating much simpler since everyone will work with the same file path. 

You will work on your computer to change the files in `~/github/[assessment]` to reflect the desired modifications your team has identified for your regional assessment.
