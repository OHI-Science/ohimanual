## Modifying goal models
In the discussion on data layers above, when an existing layer is still used as before but has a new *filename*, nothing further needs to be done for the Toolbox to incorporate this updated layer. However, if a new layer has been added to the `layers` folder and registered in `layers.csv` (and potentially added to the pressures or resilience matrices), the Toolbox will still not use it unless it is incorporated into a goal model.  
  
**There are several steps to follow when working with goal models:**

1. Update `functions.r`
2. Check and possibly update `goals.csv`

### Update *functions.r*

To incorporate a new data layer into a goal model, open `functions.R`: this script contains all the models for each goal and sub-goal. In RStudio, there is a navigation pane that can be used to navigate between them:

### Check and possibly update *goals.csv*

*goals.csv* provides input information for *functions.r*, particularly about goal weighting and function calls. It also includes descriptions about goals and sub-goals, which is presented in the Toolbox Application. 

Changing goal weights will be done here by editing the value in the *weight* column. Weights do not need to be 0-1 or add up to 10; weights will be scaled as a percentage of the goal totals. `goals.csv` also indicates the arguments passed to `functions.r`. These are indicated by two columns: *preindex_function* (functions for all goals that do not have sub-goals, and functions for all sub-goals) and *postindex_function* (functions for goals with sub-goals).

**When updating layers or goal models, it is important to ensure that information called from *goals.csv* is correct**: 

- check the years
- etc...

### Example modification: 

In this example we will walk through how to add a new layer to a goal model by following these steps:

1. decide to add artisanal access component to the model because of locally available data
2. prepare the data file; save layer ao_access_art
3. register in `layers.csv`
4. update goal model in `functions.r`
5. update goal call in `goals.csv`

Steps 1. and 2. are done outside of the Toolbox
