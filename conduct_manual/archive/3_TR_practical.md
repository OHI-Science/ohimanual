#### Practical Considerations

#### *Ideal Approach*

Ideally, information would be available on how the ocean is used for enjoyment by both local residents and tourists, thereby capturing the full value of touristic and recreational activities. Models will vary greatly depending on data available: there are many ways to potentially measure the delivery of this goal. The type of reference point used will depend on the data available.

#### Recommendations for regional assessments

This is an excellent example of having to create a model using data that are suboptimal for the goal’s aim, but it also shows how flexible the OHI approach is to adapting models with improved data or approaches. If possible, using an approach like the US West Coast or Global 2013 is preferable than the approach used in Global 2012.

There are potentially dozens of variables that affect the number of people that engage in tourism and recreation within a region and where they go, including local and global economies, infrastructure to support the activities, promotion of particular locations, safety and security, political stability, and so on. Because we currently do not know which variables matter and to what degree, or have data for many of these variables, we instead assume that tourists distribute themselves within a region proportional to where local populations are, i.e. that populated areas get a greater proportion of the tourists. The reference point used will depend upon the types of data incorporated into the model.

#### Notes:

Q: How does access fit into tourism?
A. Sustainable and thriving tourism requires you to access the coastline. It’s ok to use the same data or concept in two goals: it’s not double counting. Access is not only using the access for fishing, but also for kite surfing, surfing (!?), etc. Access to the beach by the people living in the area

Q: What are the sectors for marine jobs?
You could be employed in the TR sector
Direct and Indirect measures (economist multipliers). So we measure the direct jobs and multiply by multipliers (so that the fishermen include the bait guys, etc) where people come from doesn’t matter in the # of jobs but don’t increase the %employment. Nonnative workers: if they now live in the baltic, they should count. but migrant workers who work in the shipping industry maybe they shouldn’t count
