## Updating the WebApp's pages

The WebApp displays input layers on several pages: on the App page, Layers page, and Scores page. These input layers are displayed from `layers.csv` and the layers within the `layers` folder and the scores are displayed from `scores.csv`. While the input layers and scores will be automatically displayed on the WebApp, there is other content on WebApps pages that can be edited by your team and displayed.

For the WebApp to display the pages properly, not everything on each page can be edited as it is written in a language to create the website. But it is possible to explore the files and update much of the text that is displayed while maintaining the required formatting. To do this, follow the instructions in `update_webapps.r` and switch to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository.
