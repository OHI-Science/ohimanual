# Installing the Toolbox

>**Section Summary:**

>In this section, you will learn how to successfully download, install, and use the software required to conduct an assessment. You will create a GitHub account and install R, RStudio, git, and the Github desktop  app. OHI assessments are conducted through open-source platforms that allow you to make real-time changes with collaborators, and to track progress so that errors can be corrected and new insights can be shared in the future.

<!---OM: this is an optional new figure; drafts are commented like so in each of the Tbx sections. Remove this comment if you want to make it public: ![Before you begin using the Toolbox, you should download and install all necessary software.](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1hE5c9r5qUgAdrmzhI652zc_W1WxFVv_S1pX9h5Xyr2A/pub?w=992&h=859)--->

## Overview

The **OHI Toolbox** is essentially several folders containing all the files required for an OHI assessment. These folders are stored online on www.github.com, and are called **GitHub repositories**. At this point, you should already be familiar with your assessmentâ€™s repository, and all of the files it contains (if not, read the section, "**File System for Assessment Repositories**").  

Conducting an OHI assessment using GitHub enables collaboration and transparency, and will provide access to the latest developments in the Toolbox software, allowing the OHI team to provide support remotely if necessary.  

This section explains the GitHub workflow and how to access and setup required software. Then, it explains how to after modifying files on your own computer, you can use GitHub to upload any modifications you make so that you can work collaboratively with your team.  

**Required software:**

1. **Github App**
2. ** *git* **
3. **R**
4. **RStudio**

## GitHub

**GitHub** is an open-source development platform that enables easy collaboration and versioning, which means that all saved versions are archived and attributed to each user. It is possible to revert back to any previous version, which is incredibly useful to not only to document what work has been done, but how it differs from work done in the past, and who is responsible for the changes.  

**GitHub Vocabulary:**

* **clone** ~ download to your computer from online version with synching capabilities enabled
* **commit** ~ message associated with your changes at a point in time
* **pull** ~ sync a repo on your computer with online version
* **push** ~ sync the online repo with your version, only possible after committing

**sync = pull + commit + push**

### Learning GitHub
The following section describes how to use GitHub to access and sync your assessment repository. There are also many great resources available online with more in-depth information:
