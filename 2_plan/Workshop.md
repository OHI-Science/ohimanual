## Workshop

Following the SNA and the initial target setting and indicator selection exercises, the conveners should host a stakeholder workshop, aimed at discussing the results of the SNA as well as the proposed reference points for each OHI Goal. All people interviewed during the SNA as well as stakeholders identified should be invited and encouraged to participate in this workshop. The workshop provides an opportunity for stakeholders to work together and ensure their interests are captured within the context of the OHI assessment. Further, it is the space where the governance structure will be determined; that is, the format used to make decisions as a group. During this meeting, OHI methodology is explained in more detail to ensure all stakeholders understand the framework and the process. You should also discuss whether all 10 OHI goals are relevant to the local context Lastly, the workshop serves as an initial planning meeting. Here, you should identify potential members for the management and technical teams (or discuss proposed members), as well as develop an initial work plan of next steps to ensure the OHI assessment evolves within a reestablished time line. We developed the [OHI workshop template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzrZTod-pGCWN01LRm4tamU2V3c/view)  for your reference, but keep in mind this template should be edited to be made locally relevant.

The convener and stakeholders must decide together how far they would like to take the OHI process. There are two possible options: 1) work with stakeholders to test management options and reach agreements among them, or 2) simply provide recommendations for management based on the findings. Your decision will largely depend on local conditions, such as stakeholder willingness to continue their commitment to the process and their willingness to engage with each other to implement agreements over the short-to-medium term.

### Key workshop considerations
- Develop a locally relevant agenda using the template provided
- Create and distribute (a month prior) a workshop invitation letter
 - Ensure consistency among participant levels; recruit high-level/influential participants – need buy-in from the start to signal seriousness of intent
  - Consider private sector participation (likely via associations)
- Determine and disseminate desired workshop outcomes: commitment & work plan
- Identify a good neutral convener with skills & credibility — managing the conversation, independent professional neutral conveners are worth paying for. A good convener has:
 - demonstrated experience and skill in assisting multi-stakeholder groups to reach agreement on complex issues
 - a basic understanding of the substantive issues involved (e.g. rural development, urban informal settlement)
 - impartiality with regard to the interests of the stakeholders involved in the process, and with regard to the specific issues to be discussed and negotiated
 - Examples:  University/think tank based people (social sciences) — not marine experts, neutral institutions such as senior retired person from public/private sector (e.g., former minister), academia
- Reportage of stakeholder needs assessment (did we miss anything?)
- Discuss proposed governance structure (does it exist already? is it effective? do we need to create something anew?
- Present proposition (recommendations, proposed workplans, etc.) and leave disagreements open for discussion. Then refine proposition with stakeholder input
- Optional half day for scientific and technical discussions
- Clarify facts & options
- Questions, experts, methods, reports
- What are tradeoffs?
- Experts develop options rather than an answer — and a rationale
- Proposed reference points are discussed with broader stakeholder group
- Option: final decision is discussed with stakeholders (one last round of consultation)
