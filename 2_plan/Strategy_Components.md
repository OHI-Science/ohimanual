### Key Components of an Assessment Strategic Plan

An effective Strategic Plan includes (but is not limited to) the following key components:

- Purpose of your assessment
- Introduction to the study area, background information, and justification for using OHI
- Goals and objectives
- List of resources needed to accomplish goals and objectives (human, physical, and financial)
- Key stakeholders (refer to Stakeholder Analysis)
- Identify potential constraints
- Timeline of activities
- Communications strategy
- Linkages with decision-making
- Establish accountable and responsible individuals/organizations for each objective/task

#### Creating a Vision: What's the purpose of the assessment?

Producing the Index is not the end goal: It is merely a process toward the true end goal – achieving improved ocean health.

Index findings can be used by decision-makers to establish ocean health outcomes and management actions that have measurable impacts. Establishing a common vision and determining early in the process how the findings will be used and by whom, makes the final goal clear to the greater community (as well as to stakeholders and participants). Social, political, ecological, economic, and governance criteria should be considered when determining the goal for an assessment.

Establishing a vision is the first step, and will help identify outstanding important issues that may need to be addressed later on. Here, it is important to think about why is there interest in completing an Index assessment. For example:

* What are the existing stakeholder problems, needs, and interests that need to be addressed? Are there conflicting uses of ocean and coastal resources?

* Is the objective to use the findings to reform policies and/or improve practices?

* Are there any specific management priorities established through government mandates, private sector initiatives, and/or international treaty obligations that would especially benefit from an Index assessment?

* Are there any special management needs?

* Is there a need for stronger multi sectorial collaboration for effective management?

#### Establishing Objectives

You must first concrete objectives for the assessment process itself:
- Engage stakeholders and create **Working group**
- Identify local characteristics, priorities, and determine the goals to assess
- Define spatial regions for the assessments
- Establish **Technical Team** that will conduct the assessment
- Discover and gather data, indicators, and other information for status, pressures, resilience, and trend for all goals to assess
- Develop goal models
- Establish sustainable reference points using SMART criteria (as stated in **Reference Points** in Phase 1). Your reference points should align with management targets established on a predetermined timeline.
- Learn and use the *OHI+ Toolbox*
- Establish communications and outreach efforts

> For this step, we recommend you use the Task Timeline presented in the **Orientation**.

Second, create short and long-term objectives highlighting intentions for the findings and iterative activities for future assessments. This refere refers to specific measurable results for your assessment’s broad goals. The assessment objectives describe how much of what will be accomplished by when. The objectives should describe the future conditions after the problem has been addressed (think of the reference points), following a logical hierarchy, and illustrating their relationships with the final goal. In defining the objectives, you should also describe the intended strategies (the how) to reach the desired objectives. These strategies can range from the broad (stakeholder analysis) to the very specific (institutionalization of the Index).

#### Determining the Spatial Scale

It is important to remember that the scale of your assessment should match the scale of decision-making. Most assessments focus on political boundaries, since most agencies and organizations gather and report data at this spatial scale, however, assessments can be conducted at any spatial scale including transboundary areas and ecoregions.

Index goal scores are calculated at the scale of the reporting unit, which is called a ‘region’ and then combined using a weighted average to produce the score for the overall area assessed, called a ‘study area’.

When deciding the spatial scale of the assessments, the Working Group should consider the following:

*	At what spatial scale are most data collected?

*	What are the existing governance or political boundaries that would be relevant? (governance/decision-making boundaries are needed if the Index will be useful for management)

*	If managers and/or policy makers are interested, what needs to be measured and why? At what scale do they work?

These questions are important to keep the Index assessment relevant but ultimately data availability will be the most important factor when defining boundaries for the Index.

There is no single criterion for identifying the scale of the study area since the Index can potentially be used at all scales using data, parameters, interests, and goals at the scale of the study.
