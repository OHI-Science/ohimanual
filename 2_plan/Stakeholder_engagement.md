# Stakeholder Engagement Process

Effective ocean and coastal management is inherently a participatory endeavor. Yet, it is often the case stakeholders with varying interests do not work together, leading to inefficient and unsustainable use of ocean resources. This stakeholder process merges state of the art marine science with the [Consensus Building Institute’s (CBI)](www.cbuilding.org) multi-stakeholder and multi-issue negotiation approach, aiming at embedding scientific research within a functional institutional arrangement adequate for making decisions with the resulting information. This approach can be effectively applied across a range of disciplines and for a wide array of purposes, but in this instance we are applying it specifically for the effective implementation of the Ocean Health Index as a management approach at various scales.

As mentioned in the previous section, the OHI+ process has four main phases, two of which are highly contingent on stakeholder participation: Phase II: Plan, and Phase IV: Inform. Below you can find a detailed outline of the steps involved in each phase of the stakeholder process.

**I. LEARN: Understand the OHI framework and its potential applications**

**II. PLAN: Engage stakeholders to develop an action plan for conducting an OHI+**
- Identify the convener
- Stakeholder Needs Analysis
- Collaborative target setting and Indicator Framework
- OHI Workshop

**III. CONDUCT: Analyze information (develop models, use OHI Toolbox), identify spatial and thematic priorities**

**IV. INFORM: Stakeholders and Decision-makers work together to analyze findings and reach agreements based on the information**
- Test management options (scenarios)
- Reach management and policy agreements between stakeholders
- Implement agreements on pre-established timelines
- Reassess: establish new relevant targets and gather new information

In this section we describe the elements of the ‘Plan’ phase, which happens previous to the scientific assessment, and in section IV we will describe the components of the ‘Inform’ phase, which takes place after the assessment. Keep in mind that this approach is flexible and should be customized to fit the needs and conditions of the study area. You may also contact OHI practitioners in other countries (which you can find in the [Projects](ohi-science.org/projects/) page) for advice and guidance.
