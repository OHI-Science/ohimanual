### Establish Your Objectives

First, establish concrete objectives for the assessment process itself:
- Engage stakeholders and create **Working group**
- Identify local characteristics, priorities, and determine the goals to assess
- Define spatial regions for the assessments
- Establish **Technical Team** that will conduct the assessment
- Discover and gather data, indicators, and other information for status, pressures, resilience, and trend for all goals to assess
- Develop goal models
- Establish sustainable reference points using SMART criteria (as stated in **Reference Points** in Phase 1). Your reference points should align with management targets established on a predetermined timeline.
- Learn and use the *OHI+ Toolbox*
- Establish communications and outreach efforts

> For this step, we recommend you use the Task Timeline presented in the **Orientation**.

Second, create short and long-term objectives highlighting intentions for the findings and iterative activities for future assessments. This refere refers to specific measurable results for your assessmentâ€™s broad goals. The assessment objectives describe how much of what will be accomplished by when. The objectives should describe the future conditions after the problem has been addressed (think of the reference points), following a logical hierarchy, and illustrating their relationships with the final goal. In defining the objectives, you should also describe the intended strategies (the how) to reach the desired objectives. These strategies can range from the broad (stakeholder analysis) to the very specific (institutionalization of the Index).
