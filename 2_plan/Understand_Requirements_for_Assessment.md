You have successfully _Learned_ about OHI, and you can start **Planning** your own assessment. This section will help you understand the financial requirements, human resources, and data requirements of conducting an assessment, as well as how to engage stakeholders and assessmble a technical team, in order to _Conduct_ an OHI assessment in the next phase.

# Requirements for Conducting an OHI+ Assessment

Before you begin actually conducting your assessment (explained in Phase 3), it is crucial to have a full understanding of what are required to complete a successful assessment. Conducting an assessment is a labor intensive process that requires **collaboration, communication, funding, dedication and data**. It is imperative to ensure that you have all of these components before starting your assessment.

There are several key components to effectively prepare for your assessment:
- Implement a stakeholder engagement process
- Coordinate the assembling of a Working Group and a Technical Team
- Collaborative target setting and indicator framework (datasets)
- Organize workshops
- Develop a strategy and project proposal

Procuring funding and creating a budget that is informed by the task timeline will also aid in smart spending and decrease the likelihood that funding will run out before the process is completed.

Index scores are a reflection of data quality, and thus, accessing the best data available is of the highest importance. Data from existing environmental, social, and economic indicators may be used. All data will be rescaled to specific reference points (targets) before being combined therefore setting these reference points at the appropriate scale is a fundamental component of any assessment. This requires the interpretation of the philosophy of each Index goal and sub-goal using the best available data and indicators. For your reference, you may look at a list of the data layers used in the 2014 Global Assessment for Ecuador at http://ohi-science.org/ecu/layers/
