# Where you are in the OHI+ process

You have _learned_ about OHI+ assessments, and now you are in the **Plan** phase. Your main tasks are to understand the financial, human resources, and technical requirements of conducting an OHI+ assessment, and plan your assessment accordingly.

# Requirements for Conducting an OHI+ Assessment

Before you begin actually conducting your assessment (explained in Phase 3), it is crucial to have a full understanding of what are required to complete a successful assessment. Conducting an assessment is a labor intensive process that requires **collaboration, communication, funding, dedication** and, perhaps most importantly, **data**. It is imperative to ensure that you have all of these components before starting your assessment.

The lead organizer of the proposed assessment may want to begin by with a _stakeholder analysis_ to gain a better sense of who are the key players involved in ocean and coastal resource management in the study area. We recommend creating a **Working Group** with representatives from public sectors (government agencies, national and regional authorities, etc.), academic and scientific institutions, civil society, and private sector. Engaging these stakeholders will greatly enhance your abilities to collaborate and communicate across several groups. It will also give you access to a larger pool of resources and knowledge. The Working Group is in charge of:

- Developing a project proposal
- Assembling a qualified **Technical Team** to conduct the assessment itself (see [Team Sturcture](/plan/#team-structure))
- Managing the overall assessment process

Procuring funding and creating a budget that is informed by the task timeline will also aid in smart spending and decrease the likelihood that funding will run out before the process is completed.

Index scores are a reflection of data quality, and thus, accessing the best data available is of the highest importance. Data from existing environmental, social, and economic indicators may be used. All data will be rescaled to specific reference points (targets) before being combined therefore setting these reference points at the appropriate scale is a fundamental component of any assessment. This requires the interpretation of the philosophy of each Index goal and sub-goal using the best available data and indicators. For your reference, you may look at a list of the data layers used in the 2014 Global Assessment for Ecuador at http://ohi-science.org/ecu/layers/
