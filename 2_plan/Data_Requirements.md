# Data Requirements

The availability of local data is perhaps the single most important requirement for conducting an OHI+ assessment. **Time-series data are needed for the four components of each goal: Status, Trend, Pressures, and Resilience**.

These are the types of data that have been used in previous assessments:

 Data required for status and trend:
 
  - Fisheries and mariculture harvest
  - Natural products harvest
  - Need and ability for small-scale fishing
  - Coastal habitats coverage area and condition
  - Employment, wages, and revenue of coastal industries
  - Species list, extinction risks, and protection of special places
  - Tourism and recreation information
  - Water pollutants

Data required for pressures:

  - Ecological pressures
      - Pollution
      - Habitat destruction
      - Species threats
      - Fishing impacts
      - Climate change
      - Social pressures
  - Social pressures
    - Governance indicators

Data required for resilience

- Ecological resilience
    - Regulatory framework
    - Ecological integrity
    - Social resilience
- Social integrity
    - Governance indicators (policies, enforcement, effectiveness)

## Case Study from Colombia

When Colombia began the process of developing their independent assessment, the Colombian Ocean Commission (CCO), the lead agency behind OHI+ in the country, early in the planning process realized that despite the country having adequate information and data for the study, it was not easily accessible.

Rather than proceeding with the study, the CCO decided to collaborate with other government agencies to organize, centralize, and standardize ocean and coastal data. By partnering with the National Administrative Department of Statistics, the CCO led a process of developing methodological sheets for each indicator/data layer that will be used for future OHI+ assessments. These methodological sheets specify the type of data, the responsible agency for collecting it, the frequency of data collection, as well as the methods to be employed for collecting the information. 

By organizing and standardizing the information in this way, the CCO is not only guaranteeing scientific consistency between present and future assessments, but also allow for easier updates of the findings on a regular basis. This is a good example of how the OHI framework can yield positive outcomes even prior to the release of findings, and highlights the importance of the process over the results.
