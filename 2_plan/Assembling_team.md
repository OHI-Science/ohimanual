## Assembling a Technical Team

The success of your OHI+ assessment will depend on the effectiveness of your team. While every assessment will be done differently--it is always done according to local needs, resources, and priorities--we do have some guidance on suggested ways to go about assembling a team. Typically, team sizes have ranged from two to eight people depending on the scope of the study and the qualifications/skills of the Technical Team members. Whether members are full-time team members or contracted out depends on the assessment.  On average, most teams have around 6-10 people.

Rather than a specific number of individuals, it is very important to have a team with experts in the following fields:

* Subject-matter experts to inform goal model decisions:
  * Ecological analysts (Fisheries models, species and habitats, pollution, climate change, etc.)
  * Economic analysts (jobs, wages, revenue of marine dependent industries)
  * Socio-cultural analysts (artisanal fishing, sense of place and cultural identity)
* R analysis (statistical computing)
* Geospatial analyst (GIS or open-source software)

The OHI team can offer in-kind support (scientific, managerial, and communications), but for local technical information and support, you will require dedicated specialists. <!---From FAQ, ECU workshop 2015--->.

Effective assessments are carefully planned and require adequate project leadership and vision. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of the Index, assessments often count with participation of various stakeholder groups. Nevertheless, we recommend a key agency or group assumes the leadership of the assessment to ensure proper planning, development, and engagement throughout the assessment.

#### Case Study: The Baltic Health Index

One approach, for example, that has been very successful is to spread the goal model development across different team members. In the Baltic Health Index assessment, for example, each chosen goal has been assigned to a different "Goalkeeper," who is responsible for their technical team's development of goal models, data, as well as the appropriate stakeholder engagement. There is also a separate "Pressures" point-person and a separate "Resilience" point-person, which has proven to be an effective approach--since pressures and resilience are cross- cutting across goals, and the data for them are so important. The larger effort is then coordinated by another team member, who ensures that the goalkeepers are working toward the desired objective.

<!---From Man, before_conducting: * Assemble a qualified team with diverse skills and knowledge, including:
    + a broad scientific understanding and experience with environmental policy
    + ability to manage large data sets, make decisions, and think creatively
    + capacity to collaborate in a multidisciplinary team, remotely and in person
    + team members who can use the statistical programming language R (http://cran.r-project.org/), ArcGIS or other spatial analysis software, and are fluent in English--->
