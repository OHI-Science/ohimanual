## Identify the convener

The first step in managing towards healthy oceans is to bring stakeholders together by a convener. The convener  invites and convenes key stakeholders, facilitates discussions, provides legitimacy to the process, and establishes linkages with ocean managers and decision-makers. In the field of ocean management, government agencies and public interest organizations often become the de facto convener  due to their connections with many stakeholders, but it is possible for an individual or even a group of people with other ocean related associations to become effective conveners. An independent organization such as an NGO can help assessing potential conveners taking into consideration the convener  criteria.
The convener  identification process should take into consideration the willingness of the convener  to take on the roles and responsibilities for leading the OHI+ process. A successful convener  should commit to:

* Establishing a collaborative virtual platform for recording decisions and gathering information. Many OHI groups have used Google Drive folders to store all relevant information in the first 2 phases of the process (recommended but not mandatory);
* Conduct stakeholder mapping to identify key actors to involve in the process;
* Conduct a stakeholder needs analysis (or engage an independent analyst) to understand the concerns and issues affecting stakeholders, and gather information about targets/mandates and data;
* Host several workshops to build capacity about the OHI framework, customize the framework to local needs, discuss reference points (management targets), data availability, and other parameters;
* Develop a strategic plan for the OHI+ assessment, identifying resources needed, assembling a technical team, and determining a program timeline;
* Ensure the proper execution of the OHI assessment;
* Work with stakeholders to identify proposed management actions that can be tested within the OHI Toolbox;
* Seek agreements with stakeholders and oversee the implementation of those stakeholders.

The convener  may choose to enter into an informal agreement with the OHI Program for the development of their OHI+. We have drafted a [Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) Template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wsHmE5TKNgHo_5SxKcSR8x8FA9s28zzsxZnmG6CP2vY), outlining the role and commitments of the convener  and the OHI Program, and other related stipulations, which can be easily edited to meet local needs. The MoU can help and clarify the overlap and complementarity of interests and expectations of parties at the table; its main objective is to articulate agreement and confirm organizational buy-in.
