### Establishing Your Strategy: Creating an Assessment Blueprint

Your strategy should be a results-based planning document that details the results and objectives that will be achieved through the assessment and the specific activities, human resources, and funding needed to achieve them. Having an assessment strategy ensures that financial and human resources are used systematically and logically to accomplish the intended objectives.

Those involved in developing the assessment should use a planning approach that is familiar and comfortable to them. All strategies should at a minimum answer these key questions regardless of the exact approach or timeline:

* What do we want to achieve by developing an Index assessment?

* Who will use the strategy, and for what purposes?

* Who will be involved?

*	When will the assessment be completed?

*	What funding and support are available?

Your planning document should be thought of as an **assessment blueprint** that includes key characteristics and priorities before gathering information. Developing the OHI blueprint requires an inventory of information and knowledge that spans disciplines, space and time, and can be a useful process for understanding the current policy, information and knowledge landscape. The blueprint needs to simultaneously include broad ocean benefits and key characteristics reflecting social values and priorities specific to the context. These will extend beyond any single discipline or knowledge base and should be specified before information gathering begins. The developed blueprint will provide the necessary structure to later identify, process and combine information. Explicitly drafting the blueprint for the assessment so that it is in accordance with local priorities and perspectives makes the findings more useful for established needs. Doing this before assembling information is also critical because it can reduce potential bias, since an assessment framework built around the availability of known information may unduly skew the assessment and ultimately produce scores that misrepresent the assessment’s stated purpose. The assessment blueprint can be implemented using the best freely-available existing information, even if the information available is ‘limited’ or not ‘ideal’. ‘Limited’ information may be of low quality, have gaps, or be indirectly obtained through modeling instead of being directly measured (see Tallis et al., 2010). Remaining true to the conceptual blueprint by incorporating indirect (proxy) or place-holder information, hence developing less-than-ideal goal models, provides a fuller picture than redesigning the blueprint to only include characteristics where ideal information is available. This is because all key characteristics in the system should be represented somehow in a comprehensive assessment, even if assumptions must be made to compensate for missing information. If these methods, including assumptions and rationales, are clearly considered and explained, completed assessments will not only provide the best possible picture of the current system but will also identify information gaps and highlight areas for improvement. Such scrutiny of available knowledge could be lost if important elements were simply excluded from the assessment due to imperfect representation (Lowndes, Pacheco et al. in publication).

The assessment planning approach should be appropriate to the local context. It is important to carefully consider the physical, social, political, economic and environmental characteristics of the study area to develop a realistic and achievable plan. The process we recommend in this guide can be followed step by step, but it is better if it is adapted to local needs.

It is important to create a detailed planning timeline, detailing specific deadlines and milestones to help organize and coordinate production.
