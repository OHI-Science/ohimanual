## Communicate Results with Partners and Others

It is important to begin your communications with a strategy. The first thing youâ€™ll want to do is go back to your stakeholder analysis, breaking your stakeholders up into different groups. A good way to group your stakeholders is by their objectives. Think about the different needs of each group of your stakeholders. What information does each group need from you to meet their objectives or to perform your desired action/outcome? These groups should include decision makers, funders, the general public/news outlets, as well as other stakeholders that are important to your assessment. The quickest way to create these groups is to look back at your stakeholder management sheet at http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newPPM_08.htm.

Once you have identified your different groups and clarified the objectives for each, begin brainstorming different channels you can use for your communications and sorting them by which would be most appropriate for each group. For example, stakeholders involved in decision making and planning that you would like to help engage in informed management actions would be more receptive to a well-laid out report rather than a newsletter, article or social media post.

After selecting the proper communication tool for each group, begin planning the messages for each group. Here it might be helpful to start with the broadest group and end with the most specific. For each group, aim to answer questions such as: What are the main facts that the audience needs to know? How much background does your audience already have on this topic? When will these facts need to be communicated? What is the best channel to reach the audience?

Make sure that each message is tailored to specifically cover the needs of your audience. For example, what are the absolutely necessary facts that a policy maker will need to know from your assessment to help them better manage your marine resources? How can you convey this information in the most direct, easily accessible way? This message will vastly differ from the one sent to the general public, whose main aim will be to increase awareness of ocean health and resource management. For examples, a past Ocean Health Index Global Assessment press release can be found at www.pacificlife.com/content/dam/paclife_corp/crp/public/about_pacific_life/foundation_community/strategic_focus/healthy_oceans/081512_Ocean_Health_Index_Media_Release.pdf and the report for policy makers from our West coast case study can be found at www.oceanhealthindex.org/Apps/OHI/Vault/Output?VaultID=7899&ts=1422972909

It is important to remember that you may also want to include some of your stakeholders in this process. Partnering with some of your stakeholders might give you access to a broader demographic to help you amplify your message. You may also reach out to the Ocean Health Index team to collaborate on ways that they can help you amplify your message.

## Outcomes of OHI+

Goal scores are calculated for each region separately and then combined to produce an overall Index score for the region. Index scores are combined using an area-weighted average to produce the Index score for the overall study area.

![Scores for Ecuador (ECU) as displayed in a flower chart on the the OHI WebApp. The length of a petal indicates the score for the goal or sub-goal, and the width of the petal indicates the goal or sub-goal weighting.](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1kj11Y0lYC0t2ofKD4fDkVUxopws7pIMpxtVD5JyDhAk/pub?w=960&h=720)

Scores can then be visualized to communicate the results to stakeholders. For example, the **flower plot** shown in the figure demonstrates a useful way to represent OHI scores. Goal or sub-goal scores are shown around the outside of the plot. The length of each 'petal' represents the goal score, while the width of each petal represents the relative weighting of the goal or sub-goal. Sub-goals are weighted equally by default, as shown here, but can change depending on the regional context.

Clear communication and transparency of the process are fundamental to the Ocean Health Index overall.
