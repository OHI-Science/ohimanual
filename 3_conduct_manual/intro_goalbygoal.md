## Developing Goal Models and Setting Reference Points

Once you have determined which goals are assessed and have begun searching for data and indicators, you can start to develop goal models and set reference points. The decision tree of the data discovery process also applies here: first consider how goals can be tailored to your local context before you consider replicating what was done in the Global Assessments. It is always better to use local goal model and reference point approaches where possible.

### Developing multiple goal models at the same time

Goals can be assessed independent of one another. As each goal model is developed and data gathered, it can be assessed without affecting other goals.

 However, you can develop some goal models simultaneously. For example, the habitat-based goals. **Carbon Storage**, **Coastal Protection**, and the **Habitats sub-goal of Biodiversity** all rely on the same underlying data, and their models can be developed together. This will help streamline the data search. A spatial analyst can create the spatial layers used for these goals with the same source material. This will greatly expedite your data layer preparation. If you wish to further coordinate these activities on a higher level, you could have the same team member coordinate activities for the development of certain goals. That is a consideration when assembling your team and planning your workflow. For more details, please see the goal-specific sections.

### Keeping Reference Points in Mind

Setting a reference point is required for every goal model you develop. The choice of a reference point will affect how the final scores are calculated, and must be balanced between knowledge of the system, expert judgment, and limitations of the data and to assess the conditions of the various dimensions of ocean health.

Once you find data, always consider how you would set the reference point. Generally there are four types of reference points:
+ *Functional*: Scientifically sound target set based on the known responses of variables measured, such as sustainable catch yield.
+ *Temporal*: A historical benchmark is used as a the "ideal" point in the past.
+ *Spatial*: A region within the study area with the highest input values could be set as a perfect (score of 100), and all others are scaled to it. It's also possible to set a different reference point for each region of your study area, as was done in the U.S. West Coast study (2014).
+ *Established target*: Such as a sustainable catch yield by a certain year, or the number of people employed in a marine sector by a certain year.

Which type of reference point to use depends on the goal and available data. How many years of data are available? Can you set a temporal reference point with these data, or do you have to find another dataset or other source of information? In any case, you must balance being realistic with being ambitious. We suggest following the S.M.A.R.T. criteria when choosing a reference point: _"Specific," "Measurable," "Ambitious," "Realistic," and "Time-bound."_

You will learn more, and think more critically about reference points, as you develop the data layers for your assessment.

**_How to use the reference point in a model_**

 It's best to explicitly include the reference point in the model equation whenever possible. For example, the Carbon Storage goal model in the global assessment is written like this:

where C<sub>r</sub> is the reference condition of each habitat. See goal-specific sections for more examples.

### Identifying pressures and resilience

While you are developing goal models, you should note the links between your goals and pressures and resilience: both the pressures and resilience that affect them and whether the goal acts as pressure or resilience on other goals. It is recommended to begin gathering data of pressure and resilience from the start of the assessment. The team members who are developing specific goals should think about the pressures that act upon those goals as they are data-gathering, and they should think about the data sources that could provide pressures information. However, it may be most useful when one team member gathers all of the data for pressures, since the same pressures often affect multiple goals. See **Pressure and Resilience** section of this chapter for more information.

<!-- Ning: maybe we can move this detailed information to the pressure/resilience section.  

Julie: either way is fine with me. -->

Some pressure data are the same or closely-related to data for goals. For example, the **Wild-Caught Fisheries** goal model requires catch data, which may be the same data source for information on commercial high- and low-bycatch data, which are used as pressures layers that affect **Livelhoods and Economies** and **Biodiversity**. In global assessments, the **Clean Waters** goal is very much linked to pressures layers because the input layers for its status are used as pressure layers. Trash pollution is a pressure that affects **Tourism and Reacreation**, **Lasting Special Places**, **Livelihoods and Economies,** and **Species**. It is important to remember these linkages as you go through the data discovery process.

You should also start searching for pressures data independent from data for goals. An example would be how climate change impacts will appear in various places in your assessment. Climate change pressures layers can include UV radiation, sea surface temperature (SST), sea-level rise (SLR), and ocean acidification, and these impacts might affect such goals as **Natural Products**, **Carbon Storage**, **Coastal Protection**, **Sense of Place**, **Livelihoods and Economies**, and **Biodiversity**.

These linkages will become more clear as you go through the OHI+ assessment process.

<!-- Ning: What about Resilience? It's trickier to gather resilience data, but it's good to start thinking about resilience from the beginning.

I saw the tempnotes_b_reslilience. I can edit it and move some information over if you think it's good.

Also there are theoretical questions about resilience, but it is a discussion for another day. Does resilience mean measures to keep things the way it is (eg. grants for AO fishermen to keep fishing), or ways to help people adapt and change (eg. grants for AO fishermen to start aquaculture)?  -->


Julie: that sounds good.

Yes, we can try to get into this stuff in the resilience section-->
