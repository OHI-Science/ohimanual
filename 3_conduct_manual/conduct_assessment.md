# Conducting an Assessment

<!---See `what_is_ohi+.md`>**Section Summary:**

>In this section, you will learn what to think about before conducting an assessment. Your team should already be familiar with the OHI approach and can now prepare for tailoring it to the local context.

> TIP: Careful planning before an assessment will pay off later.--->

<!---Moved to 'What_is_ohi+.md'## What to expect when conducting an assessment

There are key considerations and processes that will be a part of every assessment, however, the process for conducting each assessment will be unique depending on the local context. For example: what data and indicators are available will determine how goal models can be tailored to the region, and what skillsets and resources are involved will affect the time it takes to complete the assessment.--->

<!---See Task Timeline in Conc. Guide
### Timeline

The time required to complete an assessment depends on the local context and available resources, but the proportion of time required for different phases of the assessment is more predictable.  

**Expect strategic planning, discovering and gathering data, and developing reference points and models to comprise > 80% of the time allotted for the assessment.** --->

<!---Moved to `what_is_ohi+.md`. ## Where to start

You should start by understanding the structure of the global assessment and the data involved will help you think about what should be done differently in your local context.  

The best way to do this is to begin with the WebApps. As described in the section, "**Overview of the OHI WebApp**," most coastal countries have a WebApp that was created to facilitate planning and communication during your assessment. The WebApp presents data, goal models and calculated scores for each region (global administrative area identified by http://gadm.org) visually through maps, histograms, and tables. All data presented were extracted from the global analysis, and scores were calculated using global goal models. For a finer-scale assessment of ocean health in your region, these data files provided will need to be updated with available data and indicators for each region in your assessment. However, if better data are not available, you can use the data provided. Then, to dive deeper into data layers and goal models, you can explore your assessment's GitHub repository, which stores all the information presented through the WebApp.  

You should also be familiar with the approaches taken by other assessments adapted from the global context, including Brazil, the US West Coast, and Fiji. You can find these studies at http://ohi-science.org.  

While our team of scientists and managers is prepared to provide guidance for assessments, you should follow the steps in this training program to complete your assessment as autonomously as possible.--->


## Points to remember

We recommend keeping in mind the following as you develop your approach:

* People are part of ocean health
    + economic and social data are included in OHI: consider how people are locally engaging with the ocean
* Goal models should be modified to capture local characteristics and priorities that can be measured with available data
    + after identifying what is important locally, identify direct or indirect measures to develop tailored goal models  
* Assessments can use a mix of regional-, country- and global-scale data
    + include the finest-scale data available, but when this is not possible, rely on global-scale data
* Scores are calculated by region and then aggregated to the study area
    + comparing scores between regions is a primary reason for conducting a independent assessment
    + goal models and data layers are the same across all regions; data values will vary by region. For example, the carbon storage goal model is the same for each region, but the habitats present in each region, and the area and condition of those habitats (the data values) are specific to each region
* All data do not need to be at the same spatial or temporal scale
    + each assessment should represent the best understanding of ocean health at a point in time. For example, if fisheries data are available from 1980-2011 and tourism data are available from 2008-2012; these can both be used to represent current ocean health
* Document all decisions made, including:
    + all data sources (publications, website URL, date of access, etc).
    + processes for establishing reference points,
    + how and why models were modified, and additionally why other potential modifications were not done, as this reminds yourself of past decisions and helps explain them to others in the future)
    + that it is important for transparency, describing methods and explaining results in reports and publications, and for reproducibility (for any future comparable assessments in your study area)


## Checklist: How to prepare for using the Toolbox

Most time spent conducting an assessment occurs before using the Toolbox to calculate scores. Prior to these calculations the Toolbox and WebApp can be used to understand the Index and as a tool to provide structure to its underlying framework. For example: how the data and models are used to calculate the ten goals (and, in some cases, corresponding subgoals) for each region and how these are combined to generate an overall score for each region can be explored with the Toolbox. At this point, the Toolbox provides a guideline for the data that must be collected and how it should be organized.  

When going through the checklist remember too that a motivation for conducting an assessment is to be able to modify goal models and set reference points using finer-scale, local information and reference points.  

The following list of tasks will not necessarily be accomplished in sequence: there is a lot of iteration of tasks as you discover data, develop reference points and models, and revisit other data possibilities. This checklist identifies decisions and steps that must be done before the Toolbox can be used to calculate your goal scores:


* Understand the philosophy of OHI
    + what the goals represent, how they are modeled, and what types of data are included
    + what pressures and resilience data are included
    + how reference points are set
* Identify local characteristics and priorities
    + what local cultural preferences or priorities should be captured in the assessment?
    + should any goals be removed?
    + should any goals be redefined?
    + should other goals be added?
    + should goals be weighted unequally?
    + what are social and ecological pressures to the local system?
    + what social and ecological resilience measures (laws, regulations, restoration projects) are in place locally?
* Be familiar with the global inputs (data and models) used in the WebApp
    + understand the data and models used in global assessments
    + prioritize which data and models should be updated to better represent local characteristics and priorities
* Decide the spatial scale for regions within the study area
    + do the WebApp regions (states or provinces) make sense? If not, what alternate scales are more appropriate?
    + we recommend multiple regions to allow for comparisons and determine geographic priorities within the study area
    + regions should be at the smallest scale the data allow
    + at what spatial scale are data most frequently reported?
    + at what spatial scale are policy decisions made (optional)?
* Discover and gather appropriate data and indicators
    + what local data and indicators are available for goal models?
    + what local data and indicators are available for pressures and resilience?
    + are available data and indicators relevant to OHI?
    + are local data and indicators at the appropriate temporal scales?
    + how should reference points be set for local data?
    + process and format data and indicators to create data layers for the Toolbox (See ‘Formatting Data for the Toolbox’ section below)
    + use the Toolbox repository as a registry to organize data layers
* Update pressures and resilience information
    + determine whether all global pressures are relevant locally
    + identify local pressures not captured in the global pressures matrix
    + categorize any new local pressures layers
    + set pressure weighting/ranking based on literature, expert opinion
    + identify potential resilience measures for each of the pressures identified
    + determine what datasets may be available to measure resilience metrics
* Modify goal models mathematically:
    + how can goal models be represented mathematically using locally available data and indicators?
    + can reference points be refined using locally available data and indicators, government mandates, management targets, obligations from multilateral agreements?
