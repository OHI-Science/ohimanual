### Sense of Place

This goal tries to capture **the aspects of the coastal and marine system that people value as part of their cultural identity**. This definition includes people living near the ocean and those who live far from it but still derive a sense of identity or value from knowing particular places or species exist. We divided this goal into two sub-goals: Iconic Species and Lasting Special Places, and weighted them equally when combining to create a single goal score. A score of 100 means the species and places important for cultural identity are protected and conserved.

#### Sub-goal: Iconic Species

Iconic species are those that are relevant to local cultural identity through a species’ relationship to one or more of the following: 1) traditional activities such as fishing, hunting or commerce; 2) local ethnic or religious practices; 3) existence value; and 4) locally-recognized aesthetic value (e.g., touristic attractions/common subjects for art such as whales). Habitat-forming species are not included in this definition of iconic species, nor are species that are harvested solely for economic or utilitarian purposes (even though they may be iconic to a sector or individual). This sub-goal assesses how well those species are conserved.

> Data for this goal will likely have considerable overlap with _Biodiversity sub-goal: Species_. It will be effective for the goal keepers of Biodiversity and Sense of Place to share the data searching efforts.

**_Ideal Approach_**

Ideally, you would have a list of species that are valued as iconic and information on their _habitat ranges_ along with scientific studies that speak to the _health_ of their populations. A reference point is where all iconic species are at a healthy level of existence.

**_Practical Guidance_**

First you need to _identify the Iconic Species_. In practice, Iconic Species are usually a subset of the broader list of species in an area, and so you should be able to find Iconic Species after having found assessed species data for the _Species sub-goal of the Biodiversity goal_. (See _Biodiversity_ for more detailed instructions.) Once you have the full list of assessed species, you can determine a subset for _Iconic Species_. For instance, are there known "indicator species" in your area? Are there species that are culturally held as valuable? Do any species appear on the currency or postage stamps?

> Since different species are be iconic to different groups, defining which species are iconic can be challenging when it's a cultural question. You might have to find information from experts on local customs and tradition.

The choice of inclusion of iconic species in your list can be subjective. You could also come up with specific inclusion criteria, for instance, that would filter a list of species or filter a subset of the gathered data for _Biodiversity_. This would be a more rigorous approach because then it could be documented and you could replicate the study in future assessments.

Ultimately, almost any species can be iconic to someone, and so the intent with this goal was to focus on those species widely seen as iconic within a country, and iconic from a cultural or existence value (rather than for a livelihoods or extractive reason). Many lists exist for globally important, threatened, endemic, etc. species, but in all cases it is not clear if or to what extent these species represent culturally iconic species. In the global assessment, species were drawn from the World Wildlife Fund’s global and regional lists for Priority Species (especially important to people for their health, livelihoods, and/or culture) and Flagship Species (‘charismatic’ and/or well-known). These lists are note the only source that included cultural reasons for listing iconic species and you should try to acquire more information on locally relevant species.

After identifying the list of iconic species, you need to find a matrix to reflect the _health_ of their population. In the global study, we used IUCN threat categories and weights. The reference point is to have the risk status of all assessed species as Least Concern. Alternatively, you can use a different kind of assessment approach to see if the populations are healthy, which could be indicated, for instance, by the stability of their populations.

Assessment | Developing the Model  | Setting the Reference Point | Other Considerations
-----------|------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
[**Global 2012**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/global) | The status was the average extinction risk of iconic species, calculated as the weighted sum of the number of species in each threat category. An increasing weight was assigned by level of extinction risk of the threat category. A list of region-specific iconic species was combined with a list of globally-recognized iconic species from the World Wildlife Fund’s global and regional lists for Priority Species and Flagship Species. | The reference point is to have the risk status as Least Concern. | The lists used were the only source that included cultural reasons for listing iconic species but they only cover a few regions and by no means capture the rich diversity of species that are iconic for local regions.
[**Global 2013 - 2015**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/global) | The method was the same as Global 2012. | The reference point was the same as Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2012.
[**Brazil 2014**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/Brazil) | The method was the same as Global 2012. | The reference point was the same as Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2012.
[**U.S. West Coast 2014**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/US-West-Coast) | This study replaced the global IUCN risk assessments with regionally-specific species assessments provided by NatureServe. | The reference point was the same as Global 2012. | Same as Global 2012, with regional data for the threat categories.
[**Israel 2014**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/Israel) | See Global 2012. | The target reference point here is that all species are assessed as “Secure”, giving a goal score of 1. | The IUCN species assessments were used for the calculation of the biodiversity.
[**Ecuador - Gulf of Guayaquil 2015**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/Ecuador) | The same approach as Global 2012 assessment was used. | The reference point was where all Iconic spices are categorized as "least concern". | Updated with local from IUCN with iconic species of the Golfo de Guayaquil. Three species from the global study were eliminated and 13 new ones were included.
[**China 2015**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/China) |Status model is similar to global assessments. However, average extinction risk of all assessed species was only calculated as the weighted sum of the number of species in each threat category, since habitat area per species is not obtainable. |The reference point was the same as Global 2012.|

#### Sub-goal: Lasting Special Places
This sub-goal focuses on those geographic locations that hold particular value for aesthetic, spiritual, cultural, recreational or existence reasons, and assesses how well they are protected.

>This sub-goal makes use of protected areas, and some of the same information gathered on projected areas can be used to create **resilience** data layers like Marine Protected Areas.

**_Ideal Approach_**

Ideally, you would be able to survey everyone in your region and produce a list of all the places they consider special, and then assess how well they are protected relative to a desired state. How well they are protected could be the percentage of area protected, and you could also find how well they are protected using other data. This sub-goal could also be based on the extent to which people participate in spiritual or religious activities in an area.

**_Practical Guidance_**

The ideal list of special places don't exist in practice, and this is a difficult goal to express accurately, since it attempts to capture how people interact culturally with their coastal places. You can define "special" with specific criteria. A good example to look at is the _U.S. West Coast assessment (2014)_ and _Brazil Assessment (2014)_.

More likely, you would follow the global assessment and use _lists of protected areas_ as catalogues of special places, and the area of designated protected places relative to a **reference point** (eg. of thirty percent coastal area protected) is used as a measure. Coastal area could be based off a 1 square km buffer inland, as in the Global Assessment, or it could be based on what is reasonable to your area. In any case, you would want to consider how far out from shore you should include as well; would it be 3 nautical miles, or as far as your territorial waters up to 12 nautical miles?

Data sources should be specific to your region. International databases, like the [World Database of Protected Areas](www.protectedplanet.net/) (www.protectedplanet.net/), offer rich information, but they may not be as up-to-date as the list of national parks in your area, and may not have as much information on the quality of protection. If you have more information on quality, you could think about another approach than the thirty percent reference point target.

Global assessment incorporated both marine and terrestrial protected areas. However, if only data on marine protected areas is available, you can calculate only the marine component of the goal. This is not ideal but OHI is flexible to work with the data available.

> If you assessment involves multiple categories (e.g., antiquities, MPAs, beaches of special interest), whether you group them together or calculate each category separately depends on reference points. Maybe you want 10% of offshore water to be in MPAs, but only 5% of coastlines to be beaches and 3% Antiquities, for example; in this case, you would calculate them separately and then add them together. But if you want 10% of your country's coast to have any combination of these things, you would keep them together.

> In the Global Assessment framework, the **Sense of Place** sub-goals were weighted equally and combined in an average to create a single goal score. The two sub-goals are averaged currently in the framework. But these could be combined with a weighted average.

Assessment | Developing the Model  | Setting the Reference Point | Other Considerations
-----------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
[**Global 2012**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/global) | The status was calculated by combining the percent of coastal waters that are coastal marine protected areas and the percent of coastline that is protected. | The reference point is 30% protection for both land and sea areas.| It was assumed that it is possible to protect up to 30% of areas.
[**Global 2013 - 2015**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/global) | The method was the same as Global 2012. | The reference point was the same as Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2012.
[**Brazil 2014**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/Brazil) | The method was the same as Global 2012. | The reference point was the same as Global 2012. | This goal was assessed using a national database of protected areas that included fully-protected and sustainable use designations at federal, state and municipal levels, and included indigenous lands. The highest-scoring area contained the largest continuous extent of protected areas within the country in what is called the Biodiversity Corridor of Amapa´.
[**U.S. West Coast 2014**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/US-West-Coast) | The model was the same as Global 2012. | The reference point was the same as Global 2012. |  The study used assumptions to define 'special.'
[**Israel 2014**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/Israel) | Archeological Protected Areas, Beaches of Special Public Interest, and Marine Protected Areas were assessed using the same approach as the Global assessment. | Reference point was set to be areas suggested to be protected by the government.
[**Ecuador - Gulf of Guayaquil 2015**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/Ecuador) | This goal focuses on capturing the current value of the percentage of protected coastal areas (1 km onshore) and marine coastal (3 nm offshore) with respect to a fixed reference value. | The same as Global 2012. | Local data comes from Ministerio del Ambiente and Fundacion Natura. All areas considered are within the SNAP.
[**China 2015**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/China) |Status model is similar to global assessments. | The reference point is only 5% protection, a target set by national marine protection policies to achieve by 2020. | Only coastal marine protected areas was considered, since protected coastline information is not available.
