### Discovering Data and Developing Models for Sense of Place
#### Where to start on the **Lasting Special Places** sub-goal of the **Sense of Place** Goal?

*Ideal Approach*

> Remember, **Sense of Place** has another sub-goal, **Iconic Species**, which is described in the *Species goals* section.

Ideally, you would be able to produce a list of all the places that people within your region consider special, and then assess how well they are protected. How well they are protected could be the percentage of area protected, and you could also find how well they are protected using other data. This sub-goal could also be based on the extent to which people participate in spiritual or religious activities in an area.

*Practical Guidance*

It is important to think about how this goal can be tailored to your region. This sub-goal is intended to be meaningful and specific to your location. Keep in mind, however, that it is a difficult goal to express accurately, since it attempts to capture how people interact culturally with their coastal places. A good example to look at is the U.S. West Coast assessment (2014).

The main consideration for this sub-goal is the spatial data and the list of protected areas. Typically in assessments, the area of designated protected places relative to a target of thirty percent coastal area protected is used as a measure. Coastal area could be based off a 1 square km buffer, as in the Global Assessment, or it could be based on what is reasonable to your area; in any case, you would want to consider how far out from shore you should include as well; would it be 3 nautical miles, or as far as your territorial waters up to 12 nautical miles?

> In the Brazil Assessment (2014), the **Lasting Special Places** sub-goal was assessed using a national database of protected areas that included fully-protected and sustainable use designations at federal, state and municipal levels, and included indigenous lands. The highest-scoring area contained the largest continuous extent of protected areas within the country in what is called the Biodiversity Corridor of AmapaÂ´.

Data sources should be specific to your region. International databases, like the World Database of Protected Areas, offer rich information, but they may not be as up-to-date as the list of national parks in your area, and may not have as much information on the quality of protection. If you have more information on quality, you could think about another approach than the thirty percent reference point target.

*Discovering data for resilenece*

You should be thinking about **Resilience** at the same time as you think about **Lasting Special Places** sub-goal of **Special Places**. This is because the **LSP** sub-goal makes use of protected areas, and some of the same information gathered on projected areas can be used to create resilience data layers like Marine Protected Areas (See section, **Pressures and Resilience**).

Once you area ready, you should return to the **Iconic Species** sub-goal of **Lasting Special Places** and think about how to combine the two together. Do you want to use equal or unequal weighting? How do the two components relate to each other?

> In the Global Assessment framework, the **Special Places** sub-goals were weighted equally and combined in an average to create a single goal score. The two sub-goals are averaged currently in the framework. But these could be combined with a weighted average, or even a different sub-goal instead of **Sense of Place**.

#### Examples of the Approach

Assessment | Developing the Model  | Setting the Reference Point | Other Considerations
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
**Global 2012** | The status was calculated by combining the percent of coastal waters that are coastal marine protected areas and the percent of coastline that is protected. | The reference point is 30% protection for both land and sea areas.| It was assumed that it is possible to protect up to 30% of areas.
**Global 2013** | The method was the same as Global 2012. | The reference point was the same as Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2012.
**Brazil (2014)** | The method was the same as Global 2012. | The reference point was the same as Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2012.
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | The model was the same as Global 2012. | The reference point was the same as Global 2012. |  The study used assumptions to define 'special.'
