### Coastal protection
This goal aims to assess **the amount of protection provided by marine and coastal habitats against flooding and erosion to coastal areas that people value, both inhabited (homes and other structures) and uninhabited (parks, special places, etc.)**. A score of 100 would indicate that these habitats are all still intact or have been restored to their reference conditions.

>This definition does not include man-made structures such as sea-walls because they are not regarded as sustainable and likely destroyed habitat.

>Habitat-based goals should be considered together during the data gathering process because the same data underly three goals: **Carbon Storage**, **Coastal Protection**, and **Biodiversity**. Goal models to date have depended on the area (square kilometers) of each habitat type in each region, the condition of each habitat, and a weighting to distinguish how different habitats contribute to each goal.

**_Ideal Approach_**

Ideally you will have information on the relative potential of habitats to provide coastal protection, and extent and condition of each habitat. The reference point would likely be a historic reference before destruction of coastal habitats.

**_Practical Guidance_**

To see how to obtain data on habitat _extent_ and _condition_, read the section on **Biodiversity sub-goal: Habitats**.

There can be many _habitat types_ included in Coastal Protection goal. In global assessments, coral, mangroves, saltmarshes, seagrasses, and seaice were included. Habitats were _weighted_ based on their protective ability identified by [Natural Capital Project](www.naturalcapitalproject.org). Depending on the habitats you include, you will need to find additional weights.

<!-- I didn't find information on how to rank on the supplemental paper or natural capital... -->

The goal status model for Coastal Protection developed for global assessments will likely be appropriate for independent assessments. However, it could be possible to incorporate the _differences in vulnerability_ between subcountry regions. Vulnerability can be quantified as the ability to evacuate, economic ability to reconstruct in case of damage. Physical properties may be available in OHI+ assessments, allowing for more a detailed understanding of the protective ability, and likelihood of exposure for each habitat type in different portions of the coastline.

Assessment | Model Description and Reference Point | Evolution of Approach | Other Considerations
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
**Global 2012** | The habitats included mangroves, coral reefs, seagrasses, salt marshes, and sea ice. The status was calculated as a function of the amount or condition of marine habitat relative to reference states and the ranked protective ability of each habitat type. | The reference point compares the current extent and condition to their condition in the early 1980s. | This focused on the EEZ scale and assumed that all coastal areas have equal value and equal vulnerability.
**Global 2013** | The goal model was the same as in Global 2012. | The reference was the same as Global 2012. | This approach followed the Global 2012 approach.
**Brazil (2014)** | The 12 nmi boundary was used for each habitat type for mangroves, seagrasses, coral reefs, and salt marshes. Only costal portions were used for mangroves. The total reported extent divided by the coastal area of each state was used for seagrasses. For coral reefs we calculated the extent per coastal waters of each state using maps of coral reef distribution. The salt marsh extents for some states were from national statistics. | The reference condition was the mean of the predicted values for 1985-1987 using regional estimations for coral reefs. The ‘current’ condition or health was the mean of the predicted values for 2008-2010.  | Same goal model as Global 2012, while using local data.
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | Salt marshes, seagrasses, and sand dunes were included. | Temporal reference points were set for each habitat. For salt marshes, the percentage of pre-industrialized habitat coverage; for sand dunes, the habitat extent between the 1950s and 1960s.  | Same as Global 2012, with more ambitious reference points for target habitat coverage.
