# Defining spatial boundaries

OHI scores are calculated for each assessment _region_, and the region boundaries will be used to aggregate or disaggregate input information reported at different spatial scales. There is no limit to the number of regions in  your assessment. However, the number is constrained by data availability and the utility of having scores calculated for a particular region. Ideally boundaries are drawn per management jurisdiction, and be informed by the scale at which information is available.

The [OHI Starter Repository](link_to_Starter_Repo_description) will help you organize preliminary data and make sure data availability matches your desired region assignments. Once you've defined your regions and drawn spatial boundaries, we can create a [Full Repository](link_to_Full_Repo_description) for your assessment.  

> Note that the OHI does not take a stance on disputed territories. The boundaries are defined by the original map data providers.

## Drawing spatial boundaries

Spatial boundaries must be drawn with geographic information system (GIS) mapping software such as ArcGIS, QGIS, or GRASS. You will need someone with GIS skills to create a shapefile that will be used by the Toolbox to display your information. The shapefile will also be used to extract information for each of your defined regions when data are reported in raster format for a different area. For more information see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system and  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile.

**Regions must be unique (non-overlapping), and boundaries must be drawn offshore**. Offshore boundaries should be made with spatial methods in order to extend boundaries from those designated on land.

Offshore, or marine water boundaries, are the greatest extent that the scores could represent, and generally extended to the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).

> Data for different goals often cover different spatial extents offshore. For example, Fisheries might use data from the entire EEZ, while Carbon Storage might only covers 3nm from shore. We don't show scores at different spatial extents on a map by goal, but instead show all to the greatest spatial extent. Because there are goals like Fisheries that usually use data for the full EEZ, the regions we need to populate a full repository have usually been the EEZ. These regional spatial boundaries do not affect data prep and analyses, where you could use any spatial extent that makes sense for each goal. 

Illustrated below is the general instruction on how to do so. Exactly where to draw the offshore boundaries is up to you. You could extend the land boundaries in a straight line as shown in the example, or you could draw the boundaries perpendicular to the shoreline, etc. In any case, make sure it makes sense in your local context and [doesnâ€™t conflict with your jurisdictional boundaries](http://ohi-science.org/manual/#strategically-define-spatial-boundaries-balance-information-availability-and-decision-making-scales).

**One possible method is to create boundaries with Thiessen Polygons**, and we provide a Python script that can be used, but it requires ArcGIS. The Python script and further details can be found at http://ohi-science.org/pages/create_regions.html.

<!-- It can also be done in [R](http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/136542/r-function-for-thiessen-polygons).  -->


## Request a Full Repository with offshore boundaries

**In order to create a Full Repository for your assessment, we will need the shapefile for your offshore boundaries.** This will help us disaggregate global data to your local regions and populate usable data layers. Please send us a .zip file of all files produced. Files with the following extensions are required (but you can send all files):

- `.dbf`
- `.shp`
- `.shx`
- `.prj`

The `.dbf` file needs the following in its attribute table:

- **rgn_id** (unique numeric region identifier)
- **rgn_name** (unique named region identifier)
- **area_km2** or **area_hectare** (area in km2 or hectares)

<!---From Mel: I just looked at what R produces for shapefiles, and it is: .dbf, .prj, .shp, .shx
shp = boundaries
dbf = database (attribute table)
prj = projection information
not sure what shx is....
So I am guessing that is all that is really needed.--->

<!-- Using Thiessen Polygons, offshore boundaries are created with the following steps.

1. Start with land-based boundaries
2. Draw offshore buffers for each region  
3. But the buffers overlap
4. For the Thiessen Polygon approach, the overlap is divided
5. To produce the borders between the regions

<!-- ## Buffers

When drawing your regions, it is also a good idea to create _inland and offshore_ buffers that will be used to extract data in your assessment. Buffers are not necessary for display in the WebApp but they will be important for later layer preparation. For example, the global assessment used coastal population information, and raster data were available for entire countries. This meant that 'coastal' had to be defined: for global assessments it was defined as 25 miles from the coast. To extract just the coastal population from the population raster file, we created a 25 mile inland buffer for each reporting region. But to extract mangrove data for each region from raster files, global assessments used 1km inland and 1km offshore as the buffer.  

At this point, you may not know which buffers you will need, as they depend on the data available, your goal models and definitions. Some buffers used in the global assessments were 1km inland, 25miles inland, 1km offshore, 3nm offshore.-->
