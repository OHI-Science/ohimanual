# Defining spatial boundaries

Boundary definitions should match the purpose of the assessment and be informed by the scale at which information is available. The boundaries displayed in your WebApp are provided by default using subcountry region definitions from Global Administrative Areas (GADM: www.gadm.org).
It is possible to redefine the spatial boundaries for your study area and regions.

> Note that the OHI does not take a stance on disputed territories. The boundaries are defined by the original map data providers.

## Drawing spatial boundaries

**Spatial boundaries must be drawn with geographic information system (GIS) mapping software** such as ArcGIS, QGIS, or GRASS. You will need someone with GIS skills to create a **shapefile** that will be used by the Toolbox to display your information. The shapefile will also be used to extract information for each of your defined regions when data are reported in raster format for a different area. For more information see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system and  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile.

Regions must be unique (non-overlapping), and boundaries must be drawn offshore, extending to the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) edge in most cases. Offshore boundaries should be made with spatial methods in order to extend boundaries from those designated on land. One possible method is to create boundaries with Thiessen Polygons, and we provide a Python script that can be used, but it requires ArcGIS. The Python script and further details can be found at http://ohi-science.org/pages/create_regions.html. Using Thiessen Polygons, offshore boundaries are created with the following steps.

1. Start with land-based boundaries
2. Draw offshore buffers for each region  
3. But the buffers overlap
4. For the Thiessen Polygon approach, the overlap is divided
5. To produce the borders between the regions

### Updating the map in your WebApp

**Once you have created your boundaries with GIS software, you will need to send them to us.** Please send us a .zip file of all files produced. Files with the following extensions are required (but you can send all files):

- `.dbf`
- `.shp`
- `.shx`
- `.prj`

The `.dbf` file needs the following in its attribute table:

- **rgn_id** (unique numeric region identifier)
- **rgn_name** (unique named region identifier)
- **area_km2** or **area_hectare** (area in km2 or hectares)

Note that we can send you the shapefiles used to create your WebApp if you would like to modify them.

<!---From Mel: I just looked at what R produces for shapefiles, and it is: .dbf, .prj, .shp, .shx
shp = boundaries
dbf = database (attribute table)
prj = projection information
not sure what shx is....
So I am guessing that is all that is really needed.--->

### Buffers

When drawing your regions, it is also a good idea to create inland and offshore buffers that will be used to extract data in your assessment. Buffers are not necessary for display in the WebApp but they will be important for later layer preparation. For example, the global assessment used coastal population information, and raster data were available for entire countries. This meant that 'coastal' had to be defined: for global assessments it was defined as 25 miles from the coast. To extract just the coastal population from the population raster file, we created a 25 mile inland buffer for each reporting region. But to extract mangrove data for each region from raster files, global assessments used 1km inland and 1km offshore as the buffer.  

At this point, you may not know which buffers you will need, as they depend on the data available, your goal models and definitions. Some buffers used in the global assessments were 1km inland, 25miles inland, 1km offshore, 3nm offshore.
