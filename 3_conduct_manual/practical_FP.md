### Food Provision

One of the most fundamental services the ocean provides people is the provision
of seafood, whether it is helping meet the basic nutritional needs of over half
of the world’s population to high-end sushi. This goal, then, **measures the
amount of seafood sustainably harvested in a given EEZ or region through any
means for use primarily in human consumption or export** and thus includes
wild-caught commercial fisheries, mariculture, artisanal-scale and recreational
fisheries.

The Food Provision goals aim to maximize the amount of sustainably
produced seafood from wild or ocean-cultured stocks; any unsustainable
extractive practices is penalized, and so is over- or under- harvesting.

Because we do not track where the fish go after being caught or produced, this
goal does not aim to measure food security for the population of a given
country, but instead measures the food provided from its waters.

>It would be ideal to include catch and effort information for commercially,
recreationally, and artisanally fished species in your area, although most
completed assessments have only been able to include catch information from
commercial fisheries due to data availability limitations. When data become
available for artisanal and/or recreational catch, they could be included as
part of the fisheries sub-goal or as a separate sub-goal depending on the
context.

> The sub-goals of Food Provision (Fisheries and Mariculture)
measure the amount of goods sustainably harvested from the sea for human
consumption, while the Natural Products goal measures the amounts of _non-food_
goods for trade (eg. coral, fish for aquarium, etc) in your study area. Data for
both goals are often recorded in the same sources. It may be time-saving for the
goal keepers for these two goals to join efforts to gather data.


**_General Approach_**

Ideally, you would have information about the quantity of species caught or
harvested (tonnes), the effort involved (particularly important for the
Fisheries sub-goal), the practices used (fishing gear, mariculture inputs,
extraction methods), and the spatial extent where the practices occur (fishing
locations, mariculture farms). Regarding the species caught or harvested in your
area, in Global Assessments, information by species for fisheries and
mariculture are processed separately before being combined to calculate status
scores.

Goal models should also incorporate a _indicator of the sustainability of each
practice_. In the case of *Fisheries* sub-goal,  Maximum Sustainable Yield
(MSY) is used as a benchmark, calculated from available harvest (and efforts)
information.

For *Mariculture*, Mariculture Sustainability Index (MSI) is used in the model.
In the global assessment, MSI is calculated based on three sub-indices that
directly measured long-term renewability of a given mariculture practice: the
wastewater treatment index, the origin of feed index (i.e. fishmeal or other)
and the origin of seed (i.e. hatchery or wild caught).

The _overall Food Provision_ model should not change; it is a combination of
fisheries and mariculture scores, with the contribution of each type of practice
to the overall score is weighted by its relative contribution to the total
seafood yield. This assumes that one tonne of seafood by any method is the same
as any other tonne of seafood. It would be possible to work with different
assumptions and apportion weighting differently.

**Pressures and Resilience** measures must be considered as well. What pressures
_act on the harvesting of these species?_ If information allows, pressures and
resilience measures can act on different species, group of species, or
practices separately, as is done with Natural Products. Fishing or harvesting
practices can also act as pressures for other goals, for example destructive
fishing practices can impact habitat-based goals and genetic escapes from
mariculture practices can affect Fisheries and Biodiversity.

#### Fisheries sub-goal

The Fisheries sub-goal describes the amount of wild-caught
seafood harvested and its sustainability for human consumption. The model
generally compares landings with Maximum Sustainable Yield. A score of 100 means the country or region
 is harvesting seafood to the ecosystem's production potential in an sustainable
 manner.

**_Practical Guidance_**

Fisheries science is a discipline that in part aims to estimate the amount of
fish that can sustainably be extracted from the sea. For this reason, it is
important to consult with fisheries experts in your study area. Fisheries
experts will be able to advise how to best estimate the maximum amount of catch
that can be sustainably fished, and the information available will determine
what type of modeling to take. There are many different modeling approaches, and
most are based on either catch alone, or catch-per-unit-effort.

> The Ocean Health Index relies on freely accessible, open-source data that is consistently updated over time. Here are two datasets used in the OHI-Global assessments, which could be also be useful for OHI+ assessments: Fisheries catch over time from the [Sea Around Us Project](http://www.seaaroundus.org) (seaaroundus.org) and Global fisheries landings over time from [FAO](http://www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/en) (fao.org/fishery/statistics/en).

_If only catch data are available_, it is highly recommended to follow the
approach in the _2013 global assessment_ (Halpern *et al.* 2015) rather than the
2012 global assessment (Halpern *et al.* 2012). All global assessments use
national fisheries catches reported to the Food and Agricutural Organization
(FAO), and the 2013 global assessment used the fisheries modeling method for
data-poor sources developed by *Martell & Froese* (2013). With this method,
fisheries catch information would be used to calculate the population biomass
(B), and its maximum sustainable yield (B<sub>MSY</sub>). The reference
functional relationship between fisheries catch and effort information would be
used to calculate the present biomass against B<sub>MSY</sub> would be used to
set the reference point. The current status would be calculated using the
present state of every individual species and combining each species together as
the weighted proportion of the total catch.

You can find data for catch-per-unit effort data, and then create a functional
relationship to determine the reference point.

> At a global scale, catch, effort, and MSY estimates are not available for
either commercial, artisanal or recreational fishing: only landings data for
commercial fisheries are available through the United Nations Food and
Agriculture program (UN FAO). You will hopefully be able to find more localized
data when conducting your assessment.

When collecting data on fish landings, it's important to consider how you will
divide the data among regions. You should try to assess each fish species by its
entire population across all regions in your study area. The status in the
global assessment model (2013) was calculated based on estimating population
biomass relative to the biomass that can deliver maximum sustainable yield for
each landed stock (B/B<sub>MSY</sub>). This ratio is conventionally used to
inform fisheries management. This approach adopts the population biomass at MSY
(B<sub>MSY</sub>) as a single-species reference point.

>If you are replicating models from the global assessment (2013-2015), do not
split the catch among regions; instead, you want to sum catch across all regions
so you can calculate B/B<sub>MSY</sub> for the whole population.

The principle of the **reference point** should not change. You should be creating
models that penalize scores for harvesting above the maximum sustainable yield,
as defined in your assessment, and scores that penalize for harvesting below the
sustainable yield. The penalties vary for models developed in the global
assessments, where overfished species negatively influence scores more than
under-fished species do.

It is important to also consider _buffering around the
reference point_ (eg. 75% of B<sub>MSY</sub>) because of imperfect knowledge about the data. Part of this
depends on the type of assumptions you want to make about the ecology of fish
species in your area and the impacts upon them from fishing practices. For
instance, when all species are exploited simultaneously, fishing pressure on
each population might be lower due to changes in interactions between species
that occur when a predator population is reduced.

##### *A note about methods used in the fisheries goal*

<p style="font-size: 90%">

Since Global 2012, several new data-poor approaches have been developed to
assess fisheries that leverage globally-available information (Costello *et
al*., 2012; Martell & Frœse, 2013; Thorson *et al*., 2013).  The estimates of
B/B<sub>MSY</sub> used in Global 2013 were obtained by applying a model
developed by Martell & Frœse, (2013), and referred to as the “catch-MSY” method.
This approach adopts the population biomass at MSY (B<sub>MSY</sub>) as a
single-species reference point.</p>

<p style="font-size: 90%"> The catch-MSY approach improves upon the method used in Global 2012 in that it
leverages a mechanistic understanding of the connection between harvest dynamics
and population dynamics and uses this to infer stock depletion levels as a
function of both historical patterns in catch and of species-specific resilience
traits (Thorson *et al*. 2013). In addition, this model is more informative in
the case of developing fisheries, whereas the Global 2012 approach assumed a
perfect score in cases where a peak with successive decline had yet to be
observed.</p>

<p style="font-size: 90%"> Although it is a data-limited method, the more complex approach better takes into
account species-specific fishery dynamics. The scores for each population were
also combined using a geometric mean, which ensures that smaller, rarer
populations have more weight so that the biodiversity of the catch is taken into
account as well.</p>

##### *Calculating the fisheries goal*

Calculating the fisheries goal using methods from global assessments (2013-2015
as it is not recommended to use methods from the 2012 global assessment) relies
on catch or catch-per-unit-effort data. The fisheries goal model uses mean catch
and B/B<sub>MSY</sub> for all species. These are two separate steps: the mean
catch is not used to calculate B/B<sub>MSY</sub>. Once you have
B/B<sub>MSY</sub> for all the species, you will combine them together to get a
single fisheries score for each of the regions in your study area. This is where
the mean catch is used: it is a weighting factor so that species with higher
mean catch will contribute more to the final score. You will not need to
calculate this because the Toolbox calculates the weighted mean when you provide
mean catch as an input layer to the Toolbox. The input layer should simply be
the mean catch for each species.

When calculating B/B<sub>MSY</sub> and mean catch, use as much information as
possible: all the years available. Species that have few years of available data
will likely be less accurate and it is important to document this. It is
admissible to have different ranges of years for different species, since too
much information would be lost if all species required the same species range.
However, interpreting why different species have different years of time series
is important. There may be data for 30 years of history for some species, 10 for
others and 5 or 6 for others. It is important to know whether there is only 6
years of data because it is a recent fishery that developed in the last 6 years;
in this case 6 years is enough. But if only 6 years of data are available
because they stopped collecting the data in recent years, you might get a
completely misleading assessment. And of course if you know there was no catch
at all in recent years, it is important to include those recent years as 0's.
0's must also be included when calculating B/B<sub>MSY</sub> or the results will
be nonsensical.

How B/B<sub>MSY</sub> is calculated for global assessments is a bit
unsatisfactory and is in the process of being better developed. This is because
the global model is very imprecise, which also affects how to interpret
B/B<sub>MSY</sub> results. **It is important to consult with a fisheries
scientist in your study area, as they will have expertise with the information
and knowledge available in the local context.** If possible, we suggest
calculating the scores using a more precise model as well, so fisheries experts
can assess whether results look reasonable. This is important so that the scores
produced have credibility.


#### Examples of the Approach

<span style="font-size:0.9em">

Assessment | Developing the Model  | Setting the Reference Point | Other Considerations
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|
**Global 2012** | The status was calculated as a function of the absolute difference between a region’s total landed biomass from the reference multi-species maximum sustainable yield weighted by a correction factor for taxonomies. This was calculated by summing all the single-species MSY estimates obtained for commercially-landed species.| The reference point was based on the difference from multispecies MSY (mMSY), an estimate of the optimum amount of all marine species that may be caught sustainably. The reference point was set so the total landed biomass of wild-caught species will not be more than 75% of the estimated mMSY using and an asymmetrical buffer where overfished stocks achieve a perfect score if B/B<sub>MSY</sub> is up to 0.2 points below 1 and under-fished stocks achieve a perfect score if B/B<sub>MSY</sub> is within 0.5 points of 1.  | The approach had to be modified by working with fisheries scientists to adapt the data that were available at the global scale.
**Global 2013** | The status was calculated based on estimating population biomass relative to the biomass that can deliver maximum sustainable yield for each landed stock (B/B<sub>MSY</sub>) using the catch-MSY model. Single-species values of B/ B<sub>MSY</sub> were aggregated using a geometric mean. | The reference point was similar to Global 2012 where regions were penalized for under-harvest and more severely for over-harvest. | The catch status was improved in this assessment to capture multi-species effects.The reference point was calculated through a more robust model than the one used in Global 2012, and it is a more direct measure of population health because it relates directly to population size.
**Brazil (2014)** | The status was calculated in the same manner as Global 2012, with a modified sustainability term. | As in Global 2012, the reference point is based on an estimate mMSY. | This was calculated in the same manner as Global 2012 using local-scale data on exploitation category of species caught within Brazil’s EEZ as a catch-based sustainability index.
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | The status was based on B/B<sub>MSY</sub> for each landed stock and fishing mortality that can deliver maximum sustainable yield (F/FMSY). There were stock assessments for 41 species with historical data available. Estimates were extracted for each species and then assigned to each region based on the contribution of each species in each region to the overall catch in that region, along with weighting factors. |  The reference point was a functional relationship that accounted for fishing pressure. The approach produced lower scores for species where both under-fishing and overfishing are occurring, but did not punish as much for under-fishing of stocks. | This study used formal stock assessments rather than data-poor estimates from catch data. The use of historical information was useful in creating sub-regional scores for this goal. This study also tested the use of a recently published data-poor approach (Costello *et al.* 2012) to obtain B/ B<sub>MSY</sub> values for the remaining stocks.

#### Mariculture sub-goal

Mariculture measures the ability to reach the highest levels of seafood
gained from farm-raised facilities without damaging the ocean's ability to
provide fish sustainably now and in the future.

Higher scores reflect high food provisioning in a sustainable manner, while not
compromising the water quality in the farmed area and not relying on wild
populations to feed or replenish the cultivated species. A score of 100 means
that a region is sustainably harvesting the greatest amount of farmed seafood
possible based on its own potential (where its maximum potential is estimated in
different ways depending on the assessment).

**_Ideal Approach_**

Ideally, you would find information about the _harvest and practices_, on the
_total area_ available for mariculture. This could be in terms of s physical area
or area based on siting priorities. You would also find information on the
_sustainability_ of the mariculture practices. This is important because
mariculture competes for space with many other ocean uses, including fishing,
tourism, and other activities.

This approach would not penalize regions that
have less geographic area available for mariculture, though places with fewer
sheltered bays or lower primary production could be at a disadvantage.

> Culture of marine fish in closed pools on-shore should not be included because onshore aquaculture does not require a marine environment. However, if the aquaculture farms receive seawater supply and return seawater back to the sea, they should be included in the Mariculture sub-goal. Finer-scale, environmental damages due to the intake pipes and the processed brine back into the marine system could be incorporated as a pressure layer as well.

> Fish that are used as feed for other fish (e.g., sprat) would be more appropriate to include in Natural Products. This is because they are not being consumed directly. Fish such as sprat, for example, may be used to feed pigs in addition to other fish, and therefore you would need to know how much (tonnage) is being produced, and where it is going to be able to accurately distinguish these categories to avoid double-counting.

**_Practical Guidance_**

Besides harvest information, either by species or total amount, this goal requires _spatial information_. You would have to find maps determining where coastal activities are allowed, or find other kind of data that tells you
the usage restrictions for activities in your waters. For example, you can look for
assessments that have been made to identify the coastal and offshore
habitats that are appropriate for each intended type of mariculture species.

> The 2012 Global Assessment included the entire area of the coastline assuming
that mariculture could be developed everywhere. This was done because there was
no information about limitations for how much coastal area could be
allotted to mariculture.

The **reference point** will depend on your context. You should try to account
for the full potential extent of mariculture in your marine areas. This could be
based on a number of variables such as the habitat suitability for each cultured
species, the distance from the coast, information on how local preferences favor the allotment of marine space to mariculture
versus sports, hotels, beaches, tourism, or other uses. This definition of
mariculture potential therefore can be physical or social. Keep in mind that in the Global
approach, a low score can indicate one of two things – that species are being
farmed in an unsustainable manner or that regions are not maximizing the
potential to farm in their marine territorial waters.

It is important to think about the meaning of your reference point. The spatial
reference point in the Global approach assumes that because one country is able
to produce such a high proportion of mariculture to its coastal area, all
regions should be able to as well, given current ecological and technological
conditions. This also assumes that it is socially desirable for all regions to
produce farmed species at this level, which is likely not true for all regions.
The Global approach compared observed production density of all areas to the
highest observed production density after the sustainability coefficient was
applied.

>There was a significant change between Global 2012 and Global 2013 to improve
the reference point for this sub-goal. The coastal population was factored in to
the reference point in 2013, where the harvested tonnes per inhabitants within
25 km of the shore was considered. This change was done under the assumption
that production depends on the presence of coastal communities who can provide
the labor force, infrastructures, and economic demand to support the development
and economic viability of mariculture facilities. Thus, two regions with an
equal number of coastal inhabitants harvesting an equal tonnage of cultured
seafood should score the same, even if one is larger than the other, as the
productivity is commensurate to each region’s socio-economic potential to
develop mariculture. This is an example of how improvements in methods occur
over time.

<!---OM: This is orphan text; was going to remove, but it might be useful or
spark other ideas that should be considered in this section! Global 2012
compared all areas to that with the highest observed production density after
the sustainability coefficient was applied, based on the assumption that all
coastal area in each region could be developed for mariculture at the same
production density as the reference region (i.e., China) and that maximum
potential productivity per unit of area is similar across ecosystems and
regions. This caused regions with extensive proportions of coastline where
mariculture is unsuitable for biological reasons (e.g., the water freezes for
large part of the year) or logistical reasons (e.g., scarcely inhabited), such
as Canada, to be unduly penalized.--->

##### Examples of the Approach

<span style="font-size=0.9em">

Assessment | Developing the Model  | Setting the Reference Point | Other Considerations
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|
**Global 2012** | Mariculture was calculated as the yield reported multiplied by the sustainability for each species harvested. Yield was drawn from UN FAO reports, and sustainability was based on information from a Mariculture Sustainability Index (MSI) by Trujillo (2008). | The reference point for mariculture was a spatial comparison set at highest amount of seafood produced per square kilometer of eligible coastline in the most productive region observed, China. | Restricting the area based on biophysical constraints and social preferences at a global scale was not possible, and so the entire area within 3nm of the coastline was considered potential habitat.
**Global 2013** | This study used a model similar to the Global 2012. |  The reference point approach was harvested tonnes per coastal inhabitant scaled to the 95th percentile observed, Thailand. Here coastal was defined as "within 25 km inland." This was done under the assumption that production depends on the presence of coastal communities. | This study differs from Global 2012 because of the reference point. |
**Brazil (2014)** | The status was calculated using harvest data reported by the Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA). For each of up to four species cultured within the state, the score was determined by the yield, the reference sustainable production per unit area, and the total potential farming area. |  Reference points were set for each species. | In this study it was possible to use both biophysical constraints and social preferences.
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | The status was calculated as the sustainable production density of shellfish biomass from mariculture relative to a target level of production density for each state within the region. | The reference point was a target level of production increase as proposed by NOAA | The approach was similar to the Global but the reference point was made using better information about physical and social limitations on mariculture allotments.
**China (2015)** | Status model is similar to the 2012 global assessment. But the status model was based on tonnes of mariculture species per habitat identified as suitable area by the Chinese government.| The spatial reference point was the region with the highest value. | Using designated mariculture area for calculations provides a more realistic picture of the status of mariculture. Currently Maricutlure Sustainability Index (MSI) values were obtained from the global study. More data on water quality standards and food sources (eg. species, origin, etc) will help determine the sustainability of mariculture.
