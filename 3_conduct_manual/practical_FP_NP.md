### Food Provision and Natural Products: Discovering Data and Developing Models

>The sub-goals of Food Provision (Wild-Caught Fisheries and Mariculture) and the Natural Products goal measure the amount of goods sustainably harvested from the sea, whether for human consumption (Food Provision) or trade (Natural Products) in your study area. Goal models are often based on the quantity (tonnes) of goods (fish, invertebrates or non-food items) caught or harvested by  different practices, and should also incorporate a indicator of the sustainability of each practice.

*Ideal Approach*

The **Food Provision** and **Natural Products** goals aim to maximize the amount of sustainably produced seafood and non-food items from wild or ocean-cultured stocks; any unsustainable extractive practices is penalized. Ideally, you would have information about the quantity of species caught or harvested (tonnes), the effort involved (particularly important for the Fisheries sub-goal), the practices used (fishing gear, mariculture inputs, extraction methods), and the spatial extent where the practices occur (fishing locations, mariculture farms).  Regarding the species caught or harvested in your area, in Global Assessments, information by species for fisheries, mariculture, and natural products are processed separately before being combined to calculate status scores.

The overall **Food Provision** model should not change; it is a combination of fisheries and mariculture scores, with the contribution of each type of practice to the overall score is weighted by its relative contribution to the total seafood yield. This assumes that one tonne of seafood by any method is the same as any other tonne of seafood. It would be possible to work with different assumptions and apportion weighting differently.

*Practical guidance*

The first thing to consider is **what species are fished, cultured or extracted in your study area**. <!---develop--->

Next, **gather as much information about these species as possible**. The aim is to quantify how much is taken, and from where, with which practices. You will need at least catch or harvest information (tonnes), but you will be able to develop more accurate models if you also have information about effort, practices, and locations. <!---develop further--->

Setting **reference points** will depend on the types of information you have. <!---develop this a bit more here, but then more specifically in sub-sections below--->

**Pressures and resilience** measures must be considered as well. What pressures act on the harvesting of these species? If information allows, pressures and resilience measures can act on different species, group of species, or practices separately, as is done with Natural Products. Fishing or harvesting practices can also act as pressures for other goals, for example destructive fishing practices can impact habitat-based goals and genetic escapes from mariculture practices can affect Fisheries and Biodiversity. <!---develop further--->

#### Additional considerations for the **Wild-Caught Fisheries** sub-goal

>The **Wild-Caught Fisheries** sub-goal describes the amount of wild-caught seafood harvested and its sustainability for human consumption.

It would be ideal to include catch and effort information for commercially, recreationally, and artisanally fished species in your area, although most completed assessments have only been able to include catch information from commercial fisheries due to data availability limitations.

*Practical Guidance*

Fisheries science is a discipline that in part aims to estimate the amount of fish that can sustainably be extracted from the sea. For this reason, it is important to consult with fisheries experts in your study area. Fisheries experts will be able to advise how to best estimate the maximum amount of catch that can be sustainably fished, and the information available will determine what type of modeling to take. There are many different modeling approaches, and most are based on either catch alone, or catch-per-unit-effort.

If only catch data are available, it is highly recommended to follow the approach in the 2013 global assessment (Halpern *et al.* 2015) rather than the 2012 global assessment (Halpern *et al.* 2012). All global assessments use national fisheries catches reported to the Food and Agricutural Organization (FAO), and the 2013 global assessment used the fisheries modeling method for data-poor sources developed by *Martell & Froese* (2013). With this method, fisheries catch information would be used to calculate the population biomass (B), and its maximum sustainable yeld (B<sub>MSY</sub>). The reference functional relationship between fisheries catch and effort information would be used to calculate the present biomass against B<sub>MSY</sub> would be used to set the reference point. The current status would be calculated using the present state of every individual species and combining each species together as the weighted proportion of the total catch.


You can find data for catch-per-unit effort data, and then create a functional relationship to determine the reference point.




> At a global scale, catch, effort, and MSY estimates are not available for either commercial, artisanal or recreational fishing: only landings data for commercial fisheries are available through the United Nations Food and Agriculture program (UN FAO). You will hopefully be able to find more localized data when conducting your assessment.

When collecting data on fish landings, it's important to consider how you will divide the data among regions. You should try to assess each fish species by its entire population across all regions in your study area. The status in the global assessment model (2013) was calculated based on estimating population biomass relative to the biomass that can deliver maximum sustainable yield for each landed stock (B/B<sub>MSY</sub>). This ratio is conventionally used to inform fisheries management. This approach adopts the population biomass at MSY (B<sub>MSY</sub>) as a single-species reference point. <!---Removed end of this line about 'conservative' approach; does not seem necessary--->

>If you are replicating models from the global assessment (2013-2015), do not split the catch among regions; instead, you want to sum catch across all regions so you can calculate B/B<sub>MSY</sub> for the whole population.

The principle of the reference point should not change. You should be creating models that penalize scores for harvesting above the maximum sustainable yield, as defined in your assessment, and scores that penalize for harvesting below the sustainable yield. The penalties vary for models developed in the global assessments, where overfished species negatively influence scores more than under-fished species do. It is important to also consider buffering around the reference point because of imperfect knowledge about the data. Part of this depends on the type of assumptions you want to make about the ecology of fish species in your area and the impacts upon them from fishing practices. For instance, when all species are exploited simultaneously, fishing pressure on each population might be lower due to changes in interactions between species that occur when a predator population is reduced.

> Global assessments adopt a precautionary estimate of the total amount of sustainably caught seafood by allowing for a 75% of B<sub>MSY</sub> buffer in the score.


##### *A note about methods used in the fisheries goal*

Since Global 2012, several new data-poor approaches have been developed to assess fisheries that leverage globally-available information (Costello *et al*., 2012; Martell & Frœse, 2013; Thorson *et al*., 2013).  The estimates of B/B<sub>MSY</sub> used in Global 2013 were obtained by applying a model developed by Martell & Frœse, (2013), and referred to as the “catch-MSY” method. This approach adopts the population biomass at MSY (B<sub>MSY</sub>) as a single-species reference point. <!---OM: this is a bit repetitive; want to keep the technical specs of this section?-->

The catch-MSY approach improves upon the method used in Global 2012 in that it leverages a mechanistic understanding of the connection between harvest dynamics and population dynamics and uses this to infer stock depletion levels as a function of both historical patterns in catch and of species-specific resilience traits (Thorson *et al*. 2013). In addition, this model is more informative in the case of developing fisheries, whereas the Global 2012 approach assumed a perfect score in cases where a peak with successive decline had yet to be observed.

Although it is a data-poor method, the more complex approach better takes into account species-specific fishery dynamics. The scores for each population were also combined using a geometric mean, which ensures that smaller, rarer populations have more weight so that the biodiversity of the catch is taken into account as well.

##### *Calculating the fisheries goal*

Calculating the fisheries goal using methods from global assessments (2013-2015 as it is not recommended to use methods from the 2012 global assessment) relies on catch or catch-per-unit-effort data. The fisheries goal model uses mean catch and B/B<sub>MSY</sub> for all species. These are two separate steps: the mean catch is not used to calculate B/B<sub>MSY</sub>. Once you have B/B<sub>MSY</sub> for all the species, you will combine them together to get a single fisheries score for each of the regions in your study area. This is where the mean catch is used: it is a weighting factor so that species with higher mean catch will contribute more to the final score. You will not need to calculate this because the Toolbox calculates the weighted mean when you provide mean catch as an input layer to the Toolbox. The input layer should simply be the mean catch for each species.

When calculating B/B<sub>MSY</sub> and mean catch, use as much information as possible: all the years available. Species that have few years of available data will likely be less accurate and it is important to document this. It is admissible to have different ranges of years for different species, since too much information would be lost if all species required the same species range. However, interpreting why different species have different years of time series is important. There may be data for 30 years of history for some species, 10 for others and 5 or 6 for others. It is important to know whether there is only 6 years of data because it is a recent fishery that developed in the last 6 years; in this case 6 years is enough. But if only 6 years of data are available because they stopped collecting the data in recent years, you might get a completely misleading assessment. And of course if you know there was no catch at all in recent years, it is important to include those recent years as 0's. 0's must also be included when calculating B/B<sub>MSY</sub> or the results will be nonsensical.

How B/B<sub>MSY</sub> is calculated for global assessments is a bit unsatisfactory and is in the process of being better developed. This is because the global model is very imprecise, which also affects how to interpret B/B<sub>MSY</sub> results. **It is important to consult with a fisheries scientist in your study area, as they will have expertise with the information and knowledge available in the local context.** If possible, we suggest calculating the scores using a more precise model as well, so fisheries experts can assess whether results look reasonable. This is important so that the scores produced have credibility.

<!---not sure this example really clarifies
Local knowledge of the fishing industry can help interpret B/Bmsy values and OHI scores. For example, consider this situation where catch data show recent decreases in small pelagic fish but increases in large pelagic fish. This can be interpreted with local knowledge: fleets stopped fishing small pelagic fish because they ran out of them and then started fishing the larger ones. OHI scores will take this into account since once you have a B/Bmsy calculated for the small pelagic species, and the model says they have declined, the score will be penalized. Though you have no catch for those species in recent years, those catch values are indicated as 0's and they are included in the mean catch, which averages across the whole time-series. This is why the mean catch throughout the time-series is included as a weighting factor.

#### Examples of the Approach

Assessment | Developing the Model  | Setting the Reference Point | Other Considerations
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|
**Global 2012** | The status was calculated as a function of the absolute difference between a region’s total landed biomass from the reference multi-species maximum sustainable yield weighted by a correction factor for taxonomies. This was calculated by summing all the single-species MSY estimates obtained for commercially-landed species. | The reference point was based on the difference from multispecies MSY (mMSY), an estimate of the optimum amount of all marine species that may be caught sustainably. The reference point was set so the total landed biomass of wild-caught species will not be more than 75% of the estimated mMSY using and an asymmetrical buffer where overfished stocks achieve a perfect score if B/B<sub>MSY</sub> is up to 0.2 points below 1 and under-fished stocks achieve a perfect score if B/B<sub>MSY</sub> is within 0.5 points of 1.  | The approach had to be modified by working with fisheries scientists to adapt the data that were available at the global scale.
**Global 2013** | The status was calculated based on estimating population biomass relative to the biomass that can deliver maximum sustainable yield for each landed stock (B/B<sub>MSY</sub>) using the catch-MSY model. Single-species values of B/ B<sub>MSY</sub> were aggregated using a geometric mean. | The reference point was similar to Global 2012 where regions were penalized for under-harvest and more severely for over-harvest. | The catch status was improved in this assessment to capture multi-species effects.The reference point was calculated through a more robust model than the one used in Global 2012, and it is a more direct measure of population health because it relates directly to population size.
**Brazil (2014)** | The status was calculated in the same manner as Global 2012, with a modified sustainability term. | As in Global 2012, the reference point is based on an estimate mMSY. | This was calculated in the same manner as Global 2012 using local-scale data on exploitation category of species caught within Brazil’s EEZ as a catch-based sustainability index.
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | The status was based on B/B<sub>MSY</sub> for each landed stock and fishing mortality that can deliver maximum sustainable yield (F/FMSY). There were stock assessments for 41 species with historical data available. Estimates were extracted for each species and then assigned to each region based on the contribution of each species in each region to the overall catch in that region, along with weighting factors. |  The reference point was a functional relationship that accounted for fishing pressure. The approach produced lower scores for species where both under-fishing and overfishing are occurring, but did not punish as much for under-fishing of stocks. | This study used formal stock assessments rather than data-poor estimates from catch data. The use of historical information was useful in creating sub-regional scores for this goal. This study also tested the use of a recently published data-poor approach (Costello *et al.* 2012) to obtain B/ B<sub>MSY</sub> values for the remaining stocks.

#### Where to start on **Mariculture**?

>**Mariculture** measures the ability to reach the highest levels of seafood gained from farm-raised facilities without damaging the ocean's ability to provide fish sustainably now and in the future.

*Ideal Approach*

Ideally, you would find information about the footprint and practices, on the total area available for mariculture. This could be in terms of s physical area or area based on siting priorities. You would also find information on the sustainability of the mariculture practices. This is important because mariculture competes for space with many other ocean uses, including fishing, tourism, and other activities. This approach would not penalize regions that have less geographic area available for mariculture, though places with fewer sheltered bays or lower primary production could be at a disadvantage.

Higher scores reflect high food provisioning in a sustainable manner, while not compromising the water quality in the farmed area and not relying on wild populations to feed or replenish the cultivated species. A score of 100 means that a region is sustainably harvesting the greatest amount of farmed seafood possible based on its own potential (where its maximum potential is estimated in different ways depending on the assessment).

*Practical Guidance*

This goal requires spatial information. You would have to find maps determining where coastal activities are allowed, or find other kind of data that tells you the usage restrictions for activities in your waters. You would also have to find assessments that have been made to identify the coastal and offshore habitats that are appropriate for each intended type of mariculture species.

The reference point for will depend on your context. You should try to account for the full potential extent of mariculture in your marine areas. This could be based on a number of variables such as the habitat suitability for each cultured species, the distance from the coast, information on which habitat is suitable, and how local preferences favor the allotment of marine space to mariculture versus to ports, hotels, beaches, tourism, or other uses. This definition of space therefore can be physical or social. Keep in mind that in the Global approach, a low score can indicate one of two things – that species are being farmed in an unsustainable manner or that regions are not maximizing the potential to farm in their marine territorial waters.

It is important to think about the meaning of your reference point. The spatial reference point in the Global approach assumes that because one country is able to produce such a high proportion of mariculture to its coastal area, all regions should be able to as well, given current ecological and technological conditions. This also assumes that it is socially desirable for all regions to produce farmed species at this level, which is likely not true for all regions. The Global approach compared observed production density of all areas to the highest observed production density after the sustainability coefficient was applied.

> The 2012 Global Assessment included the entire area of the coastline assuming that mariculture could be developed everywhere. This was done because there was not information about social limitations for how much coastal area could be allotted to mariculture.

There was a significant change between Global 2012 and Global 2013 to improve the reference point for this sub-goal. The coastal population was factored in to the reference point in 2013, where the harvested tonnes per inhabitants within 25 km of the shore was considered. This change was done under the assumption that production depends on the presence of coastal communities who can provide the labor force, infrastructures, and economic demand to support the development and economic viability of mariculture facilities. Thus, two regions with an equal number of coastal inhabitants harvesting an equal tonnage of cultured seafood should score the same, even if one is larger than the other, as the productivity is commensurate to each region’s socio-economic potential to develop mariculture. This is an example of how improvements in methods occur over time.

<!---OM: This is orphan text; was going to remove, but it might be useful or spark other ideas that should be considered in this section! Global 2012 compared all areas to that with the highest observed production density after the sustainability coefficient was applied, based on the assumption that all coastal area in each region could be developed for mariculture at the same production density as the reference region (i.e., China) and that maximum potential productivity per unit of area is similar across ecosystems and regions. This caused regions with extensive proportions of coastline where mariculture is unsuitable for biological reasons (e.g., the water freezes for large part of the year) or logistical reasons (e.g., scarcely inhabited), such as Canada, to be unduly penalized.--->

#### Examples of the Approach

*Mariculture*

Assessment | Developing the Model  | Setting the Reference Point | Other Considerations
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|
**Global 2012** | Mariculture was calculated as the yield reported multiplied by the sustainability for each species harvested. Yield was drawn from UN FAO reports, and sustainability was based on information from a Mariculture Sustainability Index (MSI) by Trujillo (2008). | The reference point for mariculture was a spatial comparison set at highest amount of seafood produced per square kilometer of eligible coastline in the most productive region observed, China. | Restricting the area based on biophysical constraints and social preferences at a global scale was not possible, and so the entire area within 3nm of the coastline was considered potential habitat.
**Global 2013** | This study used a model similar to the Global 2012. |  The reference point approach was harvested tonnes per coastal inhabitant scaled to the 95th percentile observed, Thailand. Here coastal was defined as "within 25 km inland." This was done under the assumption that production depends on the presence of coastal communities. | This study differs from Global 2012 because of the reference point. |
**Brazil (2014)** | The status was calculated using harvest data reported by the Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA). For each of up to four species cultured within the state, the score was determined by the yield, the reference sustainable production per unit area, and the total potential farming area. |  Reference points were set for each species. | In this study it was possible to use both biophysical constraints and social preferences.
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | The status was calculated as the sustainable production density of shellfish biomass from mariculture relative to a target level of production density for each state within the region. | The reference point was a target level of production increase as proposed by NOAA | The approach was similar to the Global but the reference point was made using better information about physical and social limitations on mariculture allotments.
**China (2015)** | Status model is similar to the 2012 global assessment. But the status model was based on tonnes of mariculture species per habitat identified as suitable area by the Chinese government.| The spatial reference point was the region with the highest value. | Using designated mariculture area for calculations provides a more realistic picture of the status of mariculture. Currently Maricutlure Sustainability Index (MSI) values were obtained from the global study. More data on water quality standards and food sources (eg. species, origin, etc) will help determine the sustainability of mariculture.

#### Where to start on **Natural Products**?

> The **Natural Products** goal describes how sustainably people harvest non-food products from the sea.

*Ideal Approach*

Ideally, quantity, value, and a sustainability rating of the harvest method would be available for every marine and coastally-derived natural product within the regions of a study area. This could include a wide range of products depending on what is harvested in the study area, including corals, shells, seaweeds, aquarium fish, mangrove wood, or any non-food marine product that is harvested within a region. The ideal reference point would be derived from a functional relationship of the sustainability of the harvest for each product relative to the amount of product available in the ecosystem, informed by scientific studies. Without such information, assumptions and expert judgment will need to be made to set the reference point.

*Practical Guidance*

Whether you use the approach from the global assessment or are developing your own new model entirely, there are a few tasks that will remain the same because are key to the philosophy of this goal.

The first is to identify **identify which products are in your study area.** For example, does your study area have corals, ornamental fishes, sponges? Does your area yield medicines from the sea, or other products that are not used for nutrition under **Food Provision**? Does your area harvest drinking water from the ocean through desalination plants? Is there a kelp or seaweed industry in your area? If there are multiple uses of the product, you must also consider what proportion of the product is used for food, and what proportion is used for other purposes. As another example, oil from marine mammals was considered but excluded from the global models, but if a region has a considerable amount of mammal oil harvest, they should include it in the calculation, keeping in mind that the sustainability of this type of harvest is likely to be low and should be reflected in the score.

The second task is to think about **where these products are harvested and how much of them are harvested** in these areas through a period of time. You should find spatial representation of these products, which can be done by knowing where they are derived from. Do they come from certain habitats (in the case of coral) or animals (in the case of fish oil)? This information will help calculate the sustainability of the harvest of eah natural product.  harvest amounts and the spatial data are used to calculate **exposure** further on, and can also be used to set the **relative weighting** between the products. These spatial data may have already been used in other goals, or they may lead you to find useful data that can be used in other parts of the assessment (See **Best Approaches**).

The second task is to think about **where these products are harvested and how much of them are harvested** in these areas through a period of time. You will have to assign geographic representation of these products, which can be done by knowing where they are derived from, ideally, or by assigning relative weightings. Do they come from certain habitats (in the case of coral) or animals (in the case of fish oil)? This information will help calculate the sustainability of the harvest of each natural product.  harvest amounts and the spatial data are used to calculate **exposure** further on, and can also be used to set the **relative weighting** between the products. These spatial data may have already been used in other goals, or they may lead you to find useful data that can be used in other parts of the assessment (See **Best Approaches**).

The third component is to try to find the **sustainability** coefficients of the identified products. It is possible to measure sustainability in a number of different ways. Quantitative information can be used, or expert judgment, perhaps based on information or rough estimates of how sustainable the harvest method is, which is what was done in Global 2012. We based the sustainability component on the historical maximum harvest recorded, the maximum harvesting density recorded, and risk status assessments by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).  In the absence of these, we borrowed general principles from fisheries models to provide rough estimates. If these are given values you could simplify the model, or they could be derived from two factors, **exposure and risk**. The **exposure** will come from the spatio-temporal harvest amount data already prepared, and the **risk** will come from the scientific literature or a developed indicator. For both of those cases, the values can be calculated in separate equations as part of your data preparation process.

![Natural Products goal model from OHI Global Assessment 2013](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1JFU166u9J8-bYDxeEJPKoZjHOnUtOsz4GlsxlMgKsQo/pub?w=594&h=100)

> Global assessments borrow principles from fisheries science to make estimates of product sustainability. In the Global 2013 assessment the sustainability component was derived from the historical maximum harvest recorded, the maximum harvesting density recorded, and risk status assessments by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).

One very important thing to consider at this point is your **reference point for the relative harvest amount**. The relative harvest of your data is multiplied by the sustainability coefficient in the last step. Setting the reference point is a decision your team must make based on the available data and an inferred functional relationship between the harvest of the product and the amount in the system. Understanding the patterns in harvest can help inform how to set the reference point. For example, knowing whether harvesting effort was constant or whether product yields changed due to the market demand and not the availability. This information could help inform whether it is more appropriate to set the reference point as the peak yield of the time-series, or some percentage above or below, or some other approach that is both ambitious and realistic (**SMART** principles). The decision you make for the reference point should be based on the trend of the data; for instance, if your harvests have only increased over time, which may be indicative of an emerging economy, you will have to account for that.

Example: The Global assessment used the following information in the Natural Products equations:

product | relative tonnes (1) | weighting (2) | Exposure (3) | Risk (4)
----------|---------------------|-------------|--------------|------
coral | FAO |  FAO | coral habitat | all 1
sponges | FAO | FAO | coral + rocky reef habitat | all 0
ornamentals | FAO | FAO | coral + rocky reef habitat | 1 if blast/cyanide fishing, otherwise 0
fish oil | FAO | FAO | fish score/100 | --
shells | FAO | FAO | coral + rocky reef habitat | all 0
seaweeds | FAO | FAO | rocky reef habitat | --

#### Examples of the Approach

Assessment | Developing the Model  | Setting the Reference Point | Lessons Learned
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
**Global 2012** | The products used were coral, ornamental fish, fish oil, seaweeds and marine plants, shells, and sponges. Data were from the UN FAO. Each category was weighted by the sustainability of harvest. For the status of each product, we assessed the most recent harvest (in metric tons) per region relative to a fraction of the maximum value (in 2008 USD) ever achieved in that region. | A score of 100 would indicate that a region’s natural product yield equals 65% of its historic maximum. |  Some products of interest had no data available.
**Global 2013** | The goal model had the same approach as Global 2012, with updated data processing. | The reference point was the same as the Global 2012. | The study produced new gapfilling methods. This used estimated US dollar values of harvested products from the tonnage reported, or the tonnage harvested based on a product’s reported economic value.
**Brazil (2014)** | The method was the same as Global 2012. | The reference point was the same as Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2012.
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | This goal was not included in this assessment due to lack of data availability. | N/A | There were too few data available on local-scale harvest, and in the past had occurred mostly in one Californian region. Including this goal in the assessment would have lowered the overall Index score.
**China (2015)** | Status model is the same as in global assessments. Three natural products were assessed: sea salt, chemical products, and bio-pharmaceuticals. | The reference point was the 5-year production average due to large disparities in production among provinces.|
