# Requesting your repositories 

Using the OHI Toolbox and Github Repostories for your assessment is divided into two steps. When you decide to conduct an OHI+ assessment and even before you have defined your regions, we can immediately provide you with a prepatory Github repository (_Prep Repo_) to help you through the data exploration and region-defining stage. Once you have defined your regions, we will provide you with a Full repository (_Full Repo_) with pre-populated data layers extracted from the Global OHI assessment. 

## Step 1: The Prep Repo

CNC is an example of Step 1
Describe what’s in there
Motivation: learn github, scripting data exploration, finalize regions (how many and spatial boundaries using ArcGIS)
What could we add to its README? 

 Add short description something that says: Whenever you start, you can request a prep repo that you can use to explore your data and make sure they fit with the boundaries you want. Now you can finalize your boundaries according to these criteria: XYZ (steal from best practices above). Then, we can provide the full repo templated to your spatial boundaries.

 How to request your Prep repo and brief description of why. TO REQUEST A REPO, provide the name of your assessment (our convention is a 3-letter code, e.g. gye, chn) you need it/learn github/organize data/learn to collobarate with github/script data prep/spatial boundaries. See section X for details on data exploration.
 
 How to request your full repo -- only once you’ve finalized your spatial boudaries. TO REQUEST A REPO, provide shapefiles (all of them-listed), and the name of your scenario, which is to the unit of your assessment and the year. Eg province2016, region2015).


When you first start an assessment, we will provide you a prepatory repository (Prep Repo) for you to learn how to use github while exploring data and making sure they fit within the boundaries you want. How to draw your spatial boundaries often depend on data (best practices....) and having a place to explore data will help you determine the boundaries. TO REQUEST A REPO, provide the name of your assessment (our convention is a 3-letter code, e.g. gye, chn). In your repo, an example data prep script in .Rmd and .r with data is included as a guide. 

What's in the Prep Repo: 
- Prep folder: includes a folder for each goal or subgoal, one folder for pressures, and one for resilience. 
- 

## The Full Repo
When you finalize your spatial boundareis and provide shape files... we'll provide you with a full repository with the regions defined and pre-populated data layers extracted from the most recent global assessment according to your regional boundaries.
