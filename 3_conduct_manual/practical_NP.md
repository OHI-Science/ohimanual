### Natural Products

In many countries the harvest of non-food
natural products is important for local economies and can also be traded
internationally. The sustainable harvest of these products is therefore an
important component of a healthy ocean. **This goal assesses the ability of
countries to maximize the sustainable harvest of living marine resources, such
as corals, shells, seaweeds, and fish for the aquarium trade.**

It does not include bioprospecting which focuses on potential (and largely unknowable and
potentially infinite) value rather than current realized value, or non-living
products such as oil and gas or mining products which by definition are not
sustainable.

> Similar to Food Provisions, this goal is trying to capture the value of goods sustainably harvested by the ocean. While Food Provision focuses
on goods for human consumption, Natural Products assesses non-food goods. As these two goals often share similar data sources, it may be time-saving
for the goal keepers of these two goals to work together and gather data.  

**_Ideal Approach_**

Ideally, _quantity, value, and a sustainability rating of the harvest method_
would be available for every marine and coastally-derived natural product within
the regions of a study area. This could include a wide range of non-food products
depending on what is harvested in the study area, including corals, shells,
seaweeds, aquarium fish, and mangrove wood. The ideal reference point would be derived from a
functional relationship of the sustainability of the harvest for each product
relative to the amount of product available in the ecosystem, informed by
scientific studies. Without such information, assumptions and expert judgment
will need to be made to set the reference point.

**_Practical Guidance_**

Whether you use the approach from the global assessment or are developing your
own new model entirely, there are a few tasks that will remain the same because
are key to the philosophy of this goal.

The first is to identify **identify which products are in your study area.** For
example, does your study area have corals, ornamental fishes, sponges? Does your
area yield medicines from the sea, or other products that are not used for
nutrition under _Food Provision_? Does your area harvest drinking water from
the ocean through desalination plants? Is there a kelp or seaweed industry in
your area? If there are multiple uses of the product, you must also consider
what proportion of the product is used for food, and what proportion is used for
other purposes. As another example, oil from marine mammals was considered but
excluded from the global models, but if a region has a considerable amount of
mammal oil harvest, they should include it in the calculation, keeping in mind
that the sustainability of this type of harvest is likely to be low and should
be reflected in the score.

> In the global assessments, Natural Products data come from the [UN’s Food and Agriculture Administration] (www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/software/fishstatj/en). These data are compiled and reported by product for each country, and available by downloading the FishStatJ software.

> If natural products are all produced through on-land aquaculture, you would probably have good reason to exclude the natural product goal. This would also depend on the origin of these natural products--are they from the region’s waters? You should consult with experts and any reports/papers on the topic. In addition, this goal does NOT include non-living items such as oil, gas, and mining products, because these practices are not considered to be sustainable. They are also done at such large scales that including them would essentially make OHI an index for oil and mining--and they are not truly an ocean product.

The second task is to think about **where these products are harvested and how
much of them are harvested** in these areas through a period of time. You will
have to assign geographic representation of these products, which can be done by
knowing where they are derived from, ideally, or by assigning relative
weightings. Do they come from certain habitats (in the case of coral) or animals
(in the case of fish oil)? This information will help calculate the
sustainability of the harvest of each natural product.  Harvest amounts and the
spatial data are used to calculate _exposure_ further on, and can also be used
to set the _relative weighting_ between the products. These spatial data may
have already been used in other goals, or they may lead you to find useful data
that can be used in other parts of the assessment.

The third component is to try to find the **sustainability** coefficients of the
identified products. It is possible to measure sustainability in a number of
different ways. Quantitative information can be used, or expert judgment,
perhaps based on information or rough estimates of how sustainable the harvest
method is, which is what was done in Global 2012. We based the sustainability
component on the historical maximum harvest recorded, the maximum harvesting
density recorded, and risk status assessments by the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).  In the absence of
these, we borrowed general principles from fisheries models to provide rough
estimates. If these are given values you could simplify the model, or they could
be derived from two factors, _exposure and risk_. The _exposure_ will come
from the spatio-temporal harvest amount data already prepared, and the _risk_
will come from the scientific literature or a developed indicator. For both of
those cases, the values can be calculated in separate equations as part of your
data preparation process.

> Global assessments borrow principles from fisheries science to make estimates
of product sustainability. In the Global 2013 assessment the sustainability
component was derived from the historical maximum harvest recorded, the maximum
harvesting density recorded, and risk status assessments by the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).

One very important thing to consider at this point is your **reference point for
the relative harvest amount**. The relative harvest of your data is multiplied
by the sustainability coefficient in the last step. Setting the reference point
is a decision your team must make based on the available data and an inferred
functional relationship between the harvest of the product and the amount in the
system. Understanding the patterns in harvest can help inform how to set the
reference point. For example, knowing whether harvesting effort was constant or
whether product yields changed due to the market demand and not the
availability. This information could help inform whether it is more appropriate
to set the reference point as the peak yield of the time-series, or some
percentage above or below, or some other approach that is both ambitious and
realistic (_SMART_ principles). The decision you make for the reference point
should be based on the trend of the data; for instance, if your harvests have
only increased over time, which may be indicative of an emerging economy, you
will have to account for that.

**_Examples of the Approach_**

<span style="font-size:0.9em">

Assessment | Developing the Model  | Setting the Reference Point | Other considerations
-----------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
[**Global 2012**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/global) | The products used were coral, ornamental fish, fish oil, seaweeds and marine plants, shells, and sponges. Data were from the UN FAO. Each category was weighted by the sustainability of harvest. For the status of each product, we assessed the most recent harvest (in metric tons) per region relative to a fraction of the maximum value (in 2008 USD) ever achieved in that region. | 65% of its historic maximum of natural product yield. |  Some products of interest had no data available.
[**Global 2013 - 2015**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/global) | The goal model had the same approach as Global 2012, with updated data processing. | The reference point was the same as the Global 2012. | The study produced new gapfilling methods. This used estimated US dollar values of harvested products from the tonnage reported, or the tonnage harvested based on a product’s reported economic value.
[**Brazil 2014**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/Brazil) | The method was the same as Global 2012. | The reference point was the same as Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2012.
[**U.S. West Coast 2014**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/US-West-Coast) | This goal was not included in this assessment due to lack of data availability. | N/A | There were too few data available on local-scale harvest, and in the past had occurred mostly in one Californian region. Including this goal in the assessment would have lowered the overall Index score.
[**Israel 2014**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/Israel) | Desalination from sea water was assessed for this goal. The status of this goal is calculated as the ratio of the yield of desalination and a target yield. A Desalination Sustainability was also developed and incorporated. | The target desalination yield set by the Israel Water Authority for year 2020. | The collection and trade in natural resources, such as aquarium fishes and corals are prohibited by law in Israel, but Israel relies heavily on sea water desalination to provide drinking water for over half the households. Therefore, desalination was incorporated into the index for this goal.
[**Ecuador - Gulf of Guayaquil 2015**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/Ecuador) | The approach is the same as the Global assessment. Four natural products were considered: corals, fish oil, ornamental fish and seaweed. | A temporal reference point was used for each natural product: the maximum historical value achieved for each product in each study area. |
[**China 2015**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/China) | Status model is the same as in global assessments. Three natural products were assessed: sea salt, chemical products, and bio-pharmaceuticals. | The reference point was the 5-year production average due to large disparities in production among provinces.| The set reference point resulted in high scores since it is easy to achieve a 5-year average.
