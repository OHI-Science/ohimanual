In this manual, you will find all the essential information on how to complete your own independent OHI+ assessment. The manual should be used by _Goal Keepers_ (the experts of specific goals tasked with gathering data and developing goal models), and the _Toolbox Master_ (the technical expert(s) responsible for calculating the scores using the Toolbox).  

The first four sections will be helpful for all participants, especially the goal keepers. It contains information on the Ocean Health Index philosophy, what to expect when conducting and independent OHI+ assessment, best practices, and an introduction to the Toolbox. Details on goal model development and pressures and resilience are housed separately in Appendix 1 of the manual, which includes the meaning of the goal, information selection, reference points, ideal approach, practical guidance, and examples. Appendix 2 and 3 provides guidelines on how to report data layers and model descriptions to the Toolbox Master(s).

The remaining sections, which focus on technical guidance on how to use the Toolbox and troubleshoot, will be most useful to the Toolbox Master. Appendix 4 provides an example of a record-keeping spreadsheet which will be helpful to track progress. Appendix 5 is a tutorial on frequently used R commands in the Toolbox. Conceptual and technical Frequently Asked Questions are included in the Appendix 6.
