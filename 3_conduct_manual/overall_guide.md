In this manual, you will find all the essential information on how to complete your own independent OHI assessment. The manual should be used by _goal keepers_, experts of specific goals tasked with gathering data and developing goal models, and the _toolbox master_, technical expert(s) responsible for calculating the scores using the toolbox.  

The first (3?) sections will be helpful to all participants, especially to the goal keepers. It contains information on the Ocean Health Index philosophy, what to expect when conducting and independent OHI+ assessment, best practices, and an introduction to the toolbox. The remaining sections will be most useful to the toolbox master, which focuses on technical guidance on how to use the toolbox and troubleshoot.

Details on best approaches to developing goal models are housed separately in our _Goal-by-Goal_ and _Pressures and Resilience_ Appendix of ohi-science.org, which includes the meaning of the goal, data selection, reference point, ideal approach, practical guidance, and examples.

Conceptual and technical Frequently Asked Questions are also included in the Appendix. 

If you have further questions not covered by the manual or the Goal-by-Goal section, please don't hesitate to contact our OHI+ team at _info@ohi-science.org_, or utilize the collective wisdom of the OHI+ community and find answers or post questions on our wiki page (link to the page).
