### Discovering Data and Developing Models for Habitat-based Goals

>Habitat-based goals should be considered together during the data gathering process because the same data underly three goals: **Carbon Storage**, **Coastal Protection**, and **Biodiversity**. Goal models to date have depended on the area (square kilometers) of each habitat type in each region, the condition of each habitat, and a weighting to distinguish how different habitats contribute to each goal.

*Ideal Approach*

The goal models for Carbon Storage, Coastal Protection, and Habitats developed for global assessments will likely not change in OHI+ assessments.

Ideally, information on the area extent (square kilometers) and condition of every habitat type would be available. All habitats will be included in the Habitats sub-goal of Biodiversity, but only habitats contributing to storing carbon will be included in Carbon Storage and only habitats that provide protection to coastal shorelines will be included in Coastal Protection. The reference point for habitat-based goals will likely be temporal, meaning you will compare the current area of these habitats to some area in the past, and thus historic data are needed. Reference points could also be set by with a proportion increase (or decrease) of known conditions.

*Practical Guidance*

The first thing to consider with habitats is **what habitats are in your study area**, both in the coastal regions and offshore. In the global assessments, data were available for mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass beds, salt marshes, sea ice, or subtidal soft-bottom habitats, but there are likely other important habitats in your region.

Once you determine what habitats are in your area, you will need information about **the area extent of each habitat within each region of your study area**. You should consider whether and how far they go offshore and inland. Spatial data are preferred: you will be able to calculate the total square kilometers of each habitat within each region. You will need to determine how far offshore and inland certain habitats contribute to each goal. For example, in global assessments mangrove area within 1 kilometer of the coastline were included in Coastal Protection, Carbon Storage and Biodiversity, but this distance could change in OHI+ assessments or be different for each goal.

> TIP 1: Do you have maps that show current habitat distributions and maps that show historical habitat distributions? If so, you could extract that data for each of your regions to get a current and reference area. You could also use summarized habitat data that exists in tables or are already compiled in another source.

> TIP 2:  If local data is not available, you obtain certain habitat extent data from the global assessment, which used high resolution spatial extend data from this study:
_Hamilton, S. & Casey, D. (2014). Creation of a high spatiotemporal resolution global database of continuous mangrove forest cover for the 21st Century (CGMFC-21): a big-data fusion approach. [arXiv:1412.0722](http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1412/1412.0722.pdf)_
Good data to obtain from this study include shoreline, mangrove, soft bottom, sea ice.

The **condition** of the habitats can be measured in different ways, depending on the data available. The intent is to track not only how much of a habitat there is (the km2 area) but also how well each habitat is doing. Indicators of condition could include information about habitat density, susceptibility to pathogens, or other impacts such as change in species composition or growth rates from impacts such as overgrazing. Has there been a study assessing habitat integrity or condition specifically in your area? In global assessments, direct information about coral condition was not available so it was based on the percentage of "living cover" on a coral reef relative to the potential range of the reef. Mean predicted values for each region from 1985-1987 were set as reference points.

Habitats can be **weighted** to distinguish that they contribute unequally to the amount of protection they provide and the amount of carbon they sequester. The weights of the habitats in global assessments comes from the literature, and it is possible to use the same weighting scheme. However, if you include different habitats you will need to find information to support additional weights.

If possible, you will want to gather habitat area and condition data through time so that you can calculate the **trend**. Ideally, there will be enough years of data to directly calculate the recent change in habitat condition as the trend. This isn't always the case, and proxies or estimates might need to be used. For example, due to spotty salt marsh data we created trend categories of increasing (0.5), stable (0), and decreasing (-0.5) based on available data.

The **reference point** will likely be based on historic habitat area coverage and condition, with the assumption that habitat destruction has been and still is occurring and the target is to return to some point in the past. You will need historical data for this, from satellites, published papers, or even hand-drawn maps. The challenge is to find a reference point that is both *ambitious* and *realistic* (based on the S.M.A.R.T. principles: see **Conceptual Guide**), using the data available. If data allow, it will be possible to set a reference point that is more ambitious than that used in global assessments.

> Example: In the U.S. West Coast assessment (2014), researchers went to the local public library to find hand-drawn maps of historical salt marsh and sand dune extents in California.

You will need to include area and condition data specific to your study area and not rely on the global data provided. This is because the habitat data provided for your assessment are either over-representative by allocating the study area's data equally to each sub-country region, or can be misrepresentative by allocating a proportion of those data to each subcountry region (based on the offshore area of each region to the total area). Either case assumes that if a habitat was present in the country, it could be found anywhere (which is not the case with study areas that span many degrees of latitude), and the first case inflates the habitat coverage in the study area.

There are many potential **pressures and resilience** measures to consider as well. What pressures can reduce the area or condition of the different habitat types? Pressures and resilience measures will act on each habitat type separately, so it is important to think of what affects each individual habitat types. Are any of the habitats in your study area invasive, exerting pressure on other goals?

#### Additional considerations for the **Carbon Storage** goal

For the Carbon Storage goal it is possible to include weights based on the relative ability of different habitats to store carbon. Only habitats that store carbon are included.

>TIP: Understanding habitat carbon storage rates is an area of ongoing research. The capacity for habitats to store carbon varies, and depends on the morphology of plants in the system.

*Practical Guidance*

In terms of **habitat types** for the Carbon Storage goal, it is recommended to search for mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrasses because these are viewed as carbon-sequestering habitats that are both ecologically threatened and sensitive to policy responses. Are there other carbon-sequestering habitats present in your study area? You should remember that we recommend using habitats that can store carbon on the order of 100 years, thereby limiting the types of habitat types you will need.

> TIP: If you look at your default data on the WebApp, you will see **Carbon Storage** information presented for **mangroves**, **salt marshes**, and **seagrass** even if there are no mangroves in your area: the area will be 0. You will not be scored on these if they are not in your area.

**Contribution** is how much each habitat stores relatively to the others--such as the rates of carbon uptake as measured by empirical data. For this you would have to search the literature and find ratios of organic nutrient uptake between habitats, and you would have to make sure these studies represent your study area. For example, were the studies done with a young mangrove forest, or an older one, which might have different growth rates?

The **goal status model** for Carbon Storage developed for global assessments will likely be appropriate for independent assessments. Knowing the area and the condition of of carbon-storing habitats are the two components that are most important.

Your **reference point** could be guided by a policy target instead of a historic reference point. For example, are there any climate change policies in your area, with defined targets and objectives? Are there any restoration or carbon storage projects in your area? Do any organizations offer guidance on the amount of carbon storage your management policies should be aiming for?

> Example: In global assessments, the condition of mangroves was assessed as the current hectares of mangrove coverage divided by the reference hectares (calculated from 1980 to 2005). Seagrass condition was calculated as the current percent cover of habitat divided by the reference percentage cover from 1975 to 2010.  

#### Additional considerations for the **Coastal Protection** goal

For the Coastal Protection goal, it is possible to include weights based on the relative ability of different habitats to protect the coastline. Only habitats that protect coastlines are included.

*Practical Guidance*

Coastal Protection aims to assess the amount of protection provided by marine and coastal habitats against flooding and erosion to coastal areas that people value. This definition does not include man-made structures such as sea-walls because they are not regarded as sustainable and likely destroyed habitat.
However, there can be many **habitat types** included in Coastal Protection goal. In global assessments, coral, mangroves, saltmarshes, seagrasses, and seaice were included. Habitats were **weighted** based on their protective ability identified by www.naturalcapitalproject.org. Depending on the habitats you include, you will need to find additional weights.

The **goal status model** for Coastal Protection developed for global assessments will likely be appropriate for independent assessments. However, it could be possible to somehow incorporate the differences in vulnerability between subcountry regions. Vulnerability can be quantified as the ability to evacuate, economic ability to reconstruct in case of damage. Physical properties may be available in OHI+ assessments, allowing for more a detailed understanding of the protective ability, and likelihood of exposure for each habitat type in different portions of the coastline.


#### Additional considerations for the **Habitats** sub-goal of Biodiversity

The Habitats sub-goal includes all habitats in the study area.

*Practical Guidance*

**Habitats** is included in the Biodiversity goal to provide a more complete picture of diversity in the system. This is because in global assessments assessed species data were limited and the diversity of habitats can be included with the assumption that healthier habitats mean healthier species. Therefore if you have comprehensive species assessments in your area you may not need to include habitat information as a sub-goal, instead only including living habitats (algae, corals) along with species.

#### Examples of the Approach

*Carbon Storage Goal*

Assessment | Developing the Model  | Setting the Reference Point | Other Considerations
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
**Global 2012** |  Seagrasses, tidal marshes and mangroves, were assessed. The whole extent of mangroves was included, including parts on land or in river deltas. The status was measured as a function of its current condition relative to a reference condition and a variable that weights the relative contribution of each habitat type to total carbon storage.  | Reference conditions were set as the current condition or area of coastal plant habitat coverage relative to that in ~1980. Relative contribution was measured as the amount of area each habitat covers relative to the total area covered by all three habitats given available data. | This was not a very ambitious reference point.
**Global 2013** | The goal model was the same as in Global 2012. Mangrove data included 1km inland in addition to 1km offshore.  | The reference point was the same as Global 2012. | There were improvements in data processing.
**Brazil (2014)** | The goal model was the same as in Global 2012. The greatest data gaps were for sea grasses. | Different reference points were set for each habitat. For salt marshes, the reference year was 1975; mangroves, 1980; salt marshes, 1979 - 1981. Estimations were used to retroactively determine the reference condition for mangroves and salt marshes. | The same approach was used as in Global 2012, with local data used as available.
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | Salt marshes and seagrass beds were considered. Extent was used and habitat health was not used. | Temporal reference points were set for each habitat. For salt marshes, the percentage of pre-industrialized habitat coverage; for sand dunes, the habitat extent between the 1950s and 1960s. | The study required reconstructions of historic habitat extents in order to set more ambitious targets.

*Coastal Protection Goal*

Assessment | Model Description and Reference Point | Evolution of Approach | Other Considerations
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
**Global 2012** | The habitats included mangroves, coral reefs, seagrasses, salt marshes, and sea ice. The status was calculated as a function of the amount or condition of marine habitat relative to reference states and the ranked protective ability of each habitat type. | The reference point compares the current extent and condition to their condition in the early 1980s. | This focused on the EEZ scale and assumed that all coastal areas have equal value and equal vulnerability.
**Global 2013** | The goal model was the same as in Global 2012. | The reference was the same as Global 2012. | This approach followed the Global 2012 approach.
**Brazil (2014)** | The 12 nmi boundary was used for each habitat type for mangroves, seagrasses, coral reefs, and salt marshes. Only costal portions were used for mangroves. The total reported extent divided by the coastal area of each state was used for seagrasses. For coral reefs we calculated the extent per coastal waters of each state using maps of coral reef distribution. The salt marsh extents for some states were from national statistics. | The reference condition was the mean of the predicted values for 1985-1987 using regional estimations for coral reefs. The ‘current’ condition or health was the mean of the predicted values for 2008-2010.  | Same goal model as Global 2012, while using local data.
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | Salt marshes, seagrasses, and sand dunes were included. | Temporal reference points were set for each habitat. For salt marshes, the percentage of pre-industrialized habitat coverage; for sand dunes, the habitat extent between the 1950s and 1960s.  | Same as Global 2012, with more ambitious reference points for target habitat coverage.

*Biodiversity, Habitats sub-goal*

Assessment | Developing the Model  | Setting the Reference Point | Other Considerations
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
**Global 2012** | The status was assessed for all habitats for mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass beds, salt marshes, sea ice edge, and subtidal soft-bottom habitats. Status was assessed as the average of the condition estimates for each habitat present in a region. | The reference years were between  1980-1995 and the current years were between 2001-2010. The current condition was compared 1980 for salt marshes and sand dunes, and it varied by site for seagrasses. | Anomalous values occurred due to data availability issues. A significant amount of pre-processing of the habitat data was needed to fill data gaps and resolve data quality issue
**Global 2013** | The goal model was the same as 2012. | The reference was the same as Global 2013. | The same model as 2012 was used.
**Brazil (2014)** | The goal model was the same as as Global 2012 for mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass beds, salt marshes, and subtidal soft-bottom habitats. | The timeframes between current and reference condition varied across habitats using a 20-year gap. | Information from a few point estimates had to be used to infer the health of many habitats.
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | Salt marshes and seagrass beds were considered. Extent was used and habitat health was not used. | Temporal reference points were set for each habitat. For salt marshes, the percentage of pre-industrialized habitat coverage; for sand dunes, the habitat extent between the 1950s and 1960s. | The study required reconstructions of historic habitat extents in order to set more ambitious targets.
