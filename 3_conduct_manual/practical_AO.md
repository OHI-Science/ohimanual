### Artisanal Fishing Opportunities

Artisanal fishing, often also called small-scale fishing, provides a critical source of food, nutrition, poverty alleviation and livelihood opportunities for many people around the world, in particular in developing nations. As opposed to large, commercial fisheries that usually involves industrial, energy-intensive vessels and long trips, artisanal fisheries refer to households, cooperatives or small firms that use relatively small amounts of capital, energy and small fishing vessels (if any), make relatively short fishing trips, and use fish mainly for local consumption or trade.

In addition, this goal is not about recreational fishing often done in developed countries, which is captured in _Food Provision_ (if it provides food) and Tourism and Recreation goals. Nor is it about the actual amount of fish caught or revenue generated, which are captured by _Coastal Livelihood and Economies_. Rather, **artisanal fishing opportunities measure whether people who need to fish on a small, local scale have the opportunity to do so.** A score of 100 means the country or region is meeting the needs of artisanal fishermen or communities by implementing institutional supports, providing access to near-shore water, and maintaining the health of targeted species.

**_Ideal Approach_**

Ideally, this goal would include some measure of of how easy or hard it is for fishermen to _access_ ocean resources when they _need_ them and the _sustainability_ of harvest of all nearshore stocks used by artisanal fishers. The need for artisanal fishing is most directly tied to the percent of population below the poverty line. Access, or ability to meet this need, are institutional permits or encouragements for small fisheries. Sustainability of artisanal fisheries refers to the sustainability of fishing gears. Sustainable gears are traditional hook and line, as opposed to unsustainable practices such as dynamite and gill net fishing. Sustainability can also be estimated by assessing the health of targeted species. The type of reference point you use will depend on the data available.

**_Practical Guidance_**

Ideal indicators mentioned above are often scarce, especially percent poverty or the sustainability of fishing gears. You will want to find proxy data for *access* in whatever way best suits your areas. This could be drawn from physical, economic, regulatory, or stock condition data as an indication of availability. A combination of all of these would be best to more accurately speak to the philosophy, but is is usually limited by data.

> In the U.S. West Coast Assessment (2014), three metrics were used to define **Artisanal Opportunity** that you can use to study:

<span style="font-size=0.9em">

| Type of Access | Data Used | Reference Point |
|-----|------|-------|
| Physical | Number of coastal access points per mile | 1 coastal access point per mile |
| Economic | Change in gas price over time | No change in gas price |
| Resource | Condition of fish stocks through NOAA Fish Stock Index | Perfect sustainability score on FSI |

You should include data that are distinct from the catch data used in other areas of **Food Provision**. So once you find catch data and access data, you should think about which goals to use it in. For instance, if you find tonnage of artisanally-caught fish, you should include that elsewhere. In any case, you will likely modify the default Global Assessment model using different and better-resolved data.

>For example, in the Baltic Sea region, **Artisanal Opportunities** is very closely connected to **Tourism and Recreation** since there are a lot of locals and tourists using the shared sea for enjoyment. You will have to decide how to apportion the data.


The **reference point for this goal** would likely be a metric of having full access to the resource (see examples in the table above). Keep in mind that the access is for people, and therefore a marine protected area may not count towards full access.

**_Examples of the Approach_**

Assessment | Developing the Model  | Setting the Reference Point | Other Considerations
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|
**Global 2012** | The status was the demand as estimated by poverty levels. The data were measured by the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, adjusted by the purchasing power parity as a proxy for undocumented trade. The supply was estimated using an indicator that ranked how well regions regulated and supported artisanal fishing, as part of a study by Mora *et al.* (2009). | The reference point was having supply greater than demand so that unmet demand is 0. This meant that all demand for artisanal fishing was allowed or achieved. | The trend was driven by the change over time in PPPpcGDP as a proxy for demand. This assessment did not incorporate a specific measure of the health of the targeted species or of sustainability of practices.
**Global 2013** | The approach was the same was Global 2012 | The reference point was the same as Global 2012. | There were no data updates available to change the method.
**Brazil (2014)** | The model was simplified to reflect the primary driver of opportunity as the availability of fish to be captured, as measured by the condition of stocks. This model was based solely on the sustainability index calculated using the exploitation status of species. All species were considered possible targets of artisanal fishing activities. | The reference point for artisanal fishing opportunities was an established target of 1.0. This meant all stocks are categorized as either Developing or Fully Exploited. | The analysis used national stock status information. It did not include poverty because of the high variation in the country. In addition, it assumes that access to fishing is largely open because permitting and regulations are not restricted.
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | This study developed a model using three key variables of physical and economic access to coastal areas, and access to biological resources. The physical accesses was shore-based fishing measured by percent of coastline within a mile coastal access points. Economic access was no increase in fuel price compared to income. Biological access was the health of the fish stocks. | The target here is to maximize the amount of public access along the coast, therefore a perfect score results when each part of a regionâ€™s coastline has a coastal access point within 1 mile. The study calculated these scores using a raster map allocation. | This approach did not model demand or have species-specific information. It assumed that as long as there are no obstacles to pursuing artisanal fishing, the goal was fully achieved. These data better capture the nature of small-scale fisheries in the study area than the Global model.
**China (2015)** | Status model is rewritten and is similar to the 2014 U.S. West Coast assessment. It is based on the three indicators: <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- capacity for exports, measured by the number of portsk <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- the need for artisanal fishing opportunities, represented by the number of artisanal fishermen <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- economic capacity, measured by the ratio of diesel price and disposable income. | The spatial reference point is the maximum value across all region and all years.
