### Livelihoods and Economies

The jobs and revenue produced from marine-related industries are clearly of huge value to many people, even for those people who do not directly participate in marine-related industries. People value community identity, tax revenue, and indirect economic and social impacts of a stable coastal economy. This goal tracks **the number and quality of jobs and the amount of revenue produced across as many marine-related industries/sectors as possible** through two sub-goals, Livelihoods and Economies. A score of 100 reflects productive coastal economies that avoid the loss of ocean-dependent livelihoods while maximizing livelihood quality.

In the global study, this goal does not attempt to capture any aspects of _job identity_ (i.e. the reputation, desirability or other social or cultural perspectives associated with different jobs). We make the assumption that all marine-related jobs are equivalent, such that, for example, a fisherman could transition to a job in mariculture or ship-building without affecting the score of this goal. There are also not adequate data to assess workers' _job satisfaction_ or _ecological sustainability_ of sectors. Future, finer scale applications of the Index could incorporate these key considerations.

> Oil and gas industries typically are not included in this goal. The Natural Products goal does not include non-living items such as oil, gas, and mining products, because these practices are not considered to be sustainable. They are also done at such large scales that including them would essentially make OHI an index for oil and mining--and they are not truly an ocean product. Because these products are not included in terms of quantity extracted, it did not seem appropriate to include information regarding jobs, wages or revenue. However, oil and gas industries are considered a large employer and often generate large revenue for a region. Similarly, industries such as shipping, boat building, ports and harbors do not directly depend on a healthy ocean, but the demand for some of those boats (fishing boats, sailboats, yachts) is dependent on a healthy ocean and are also important providers of jobs and revenue. Ultimately, whether and how to include those data is a decision that should be made on a case-by-case basis by the individual OHI+ group. 

#### Sub-goal: Livelihoods

This sub-goal describes livelihood quantity and quality for
people living on the coast. Livelihoods includes two equally important sub-components, the number of jobs, which is a proxy for livelihood quantity, and the per capita average annual wages,
which is a proxy for job quality.

**_Ideal Approach_**

Ideally, this sub-goal would speak to the quality and quantity of marine jobs in an area. It would encompass all the marine sectors that supply jobs and wages to coastal communities, incorporating information on the _sustainability_ of different sectors while also telling about the _working conditions and job satisfaction_. The jobs and revenue produced from marine-related industries directly benefit those who are employed, and also those who gain indirect value from related economic and social impacts of a stable coastal economy, such as community identity and tax revenue. You should capture the indirect as well as direct benefits from jobs, wages and revenue from coastal communities.

In your assessment, there is the opportunity to study the behavior of economic trends in your area. You can examine time-series with greater detail and, for example, establish a different time-periods that reflect economic cycles in your area, or even process the data to eliminate the “noise” from fluctuations and capture more persistent trends.

> You will most likely simplify the models from the global assessments. Models in the global assessments adjust for currency differences using the the Consumer Price Index and Purchasing Power Parity, which you likely will not need to do.

**_Practical Guidance_**

The first step of this goal is to **identify the marine-related sectors in your area**. These sectors are important because the *Livelihoods* goal includes information about **jobs** and **wages** for those sectors. There are jobs that are directly connected to the marine environment, such as shipping, fishing, longshore workers, but also some that are connected indirectly, such as suppliers and supporting industries. For example, the sectors for which data were found in global assessments included tourism, commercial fishing, marine mammal watching, aquarium fishing, water and tidal energy jobs, mariculture, transportation and shipping, ports and harbors, ship and boatbuilding.

After you have identified which jobs are in your area, you will want to find some **measure of their direct and indirect benefits**. Direct benefits of jobs include the number of jobs in each area, and the wages or income for such jobs. You could find such information from you local national statistical office, or economics bureaus, for example. Indirect benefits of these jobs to the local communities are calculated through the use of _economic multipliers_, with which you can attempt to estimate the revenue generated by jobs more broadly associated with marine sectors. It's encouraged to use economic multipliers from the literature.

> One example to use economic multipliers is to multiply the number of fishermen by a multiplier to estimate larger economic effects, ranging
from gear manufacturing companies to restaurants and movie theaters where the fishermen spend their income.

Next you must think about how to use the data to infer **quality and quantity of jobs**. Do you have data through time so that you can see how the number of jobs or the wages per sector have changed over time? If all of the sectors change in the same way, for instance, this might show broader economic trends that you should account for.

<!-- what are good ways to find satisfaction, identity, and sustainability information of different sectors? -->

>It is highly recommended that you set the **reference point** for _jobs_ as a *temporal comparison* (eg. the number of jobs five years before), and for for wages as a *spatial comparison* (eg. highest observed value across reporting units). Comparing the number of jobs across different places, for instance, would require at the
very least adjusting values by the size of the workforce in each location.

**_Examples of the Approaches_**

Assessment | Developing the Model  | Setting the Reference Point | Other Considerations
---------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|
[**Global 2012**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/global) | This was measured as the number of direct and indirect jobs across sectors within a region plus the average purchasing power parity (PPP)-adjusted wages within each sector. Jobs were summed across sectors and wages were averages across sectors within each region. | The reference point for jobs was a temporal comparison using a moving-window value; the reference point for wages was the highest average annual wage observed across all reporting units. A score of 100 indicated that the number of marine jobs had not reduced relative to the number five years previously, and that the wages in the area were the highest anywhere. | The goal model assumed there was no-net-loss of jobs in order to account for broader economic trends. The economic multipliers were used for jobs and revenue but not wages.
[**Global 2013 - 2015**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/global) | The model was similar to Global 2012, with some simplifications. | The reference point was the same as Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2012 except for a few simplifications in multipliers, wage data, and jobs data. This was done because of data availability and in order to correct for national macroeconomic events across all sectors.
[**Brazil 2014**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/Brazil) | The method was the same as Global 2012. | The reference point was the same as Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2012.
[**U.S. West Coast 2014**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/US-West-Coast) | This goal follows the same model as in Global 2012, using local data for the sectors of living resources, tourism and recreation, shipping and transport, marine related construction, and ship and boat building or repair. Data and sector-specific multipliers came from the National Ocean Economics Program (NOEP). | The reference point was the same as in Global 2012. | This study followed the Global 2012 approach but used local data. It recognized that sectors and economic activity within a region can be influenced by activities outside the region.
[**Israel 2014**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/Israel) | See Global 2012 assessment. | No-net-loss reference point. | 
[**Ecuador - Gulf of Guayaquil 2015**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/Ecuador) | The approach is the same as the Global assessment. | A temporal reference poinst was used for both the number of jobs and salaries. 2009 values were used as the reference point for jobs, and values of 2010 for salaries. | Data for jobs, wages, and unemployment were gap-filled. 
[**China 2015**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/China) |Status model is the based on the number of direct jobs across marine sectors and the average disposable income among rural and urban inhabitants within a region. |Both jobs and wages have a spatial reference point of the maximum value among all provinces across all years. | Eleven marine sectors are assessed. The number of jobs per sector is not readily available and is extenuated from the nation-wide number of employments for each sector and the total number of marine-related jobs per province. There is not enough information on indirect jobs and is thus left out of the calculation. Due to unavailability of wage information per sector, wage is substituted by disposable income.

#### Sub-goal: Economies

Economies captures the economic value associated with marine industries using revenue from marine sectors. It is composed of a single component, revenue.

**_Ideal Approach_**

Ideally, revenue data would be collected for all coastal regions, and traced from sectors both directly and indirectly related to marine industries. When these data are not available it is possible to use revenue data at a larger scale and adapt them to a coastal area based on the population distribution. The reference point in this sub-goal will likely be set with a moving-window temporal approach.

**_Practical Guidance_**

A number of sectors were not included in the Global Assessments because sufficient data did not exist. However, it might be desirable to include sectors such as ecotourism, sailing, kayaking, surfing, and offshore wind energy production, and scientific research, among others. It may be practical to include the same sectors in the *Livelihoods* and the *Economies* subgoals.

> The quantity of Wild-caught fisheries, Mariculture, and participation of Tourism & Recreation are considered separately in specific goals, whereas the monetary component is captured in L&E.

In the global assessment, revenue has a moving-target temporal **reference point** by comparing the value in the current year to values in previous years. Global assessments used a five-year moving-window because it is intended to capture short-term changes in the trajectory. But then you must consider if that amount of time would represent economic trends. If there is a not economic downturn, do you want to reward an increasing number of jobs, or reward maintaining the same
number of jobs?

We highly recommend that this remains a temporal comparison so that a specific place is compared to its performance in the past and not to anywhere else.

>You may find resilience metrics that can be
used throughout your assessment. There are many economic indices and some might be appropriate for your area. For example, the _Global Competitiveness Index_ was used in global assessments as a resilience for this goal because it means that marine jobs are more likely to be maintained if an area gets a good score on the Competitiveness Index.

Assessment | Developing the Model  | Setting the Reference Point | Other Considerations
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
[**Global 2012**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/global) | The status used the total adjusted revenue generated directly and indirectly from each sector at current and reference time points. | In the economies sub-goal, revenue had a moving target temporal comparison. A score of 100 would indicate that revenue has not decreased compared to its value five years previous. The years used for GDP data were based on the average current year and average reference year across the sector data sources. | The study accounted for a region's GDP trend. The economic multipliers were used for jobs and revenue but not wages. The study assumed that sector-specific job and revenue multipliers were static and globally consistent, but distinct for developed versus developing regions.
[**Global 2013 - 2015**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/global) | The model was same as Global 2012, with a few simplifications;  revenue data were adjusted by dividing by GDP per region, reported in 2013 USD. | The reference point was the same as Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2012, with simplifications.
[**Brazil 2014**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/Brazil) | The method was the same as Global 2012. | The reference point was the same as Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2012.
[**U.S. West Coast 2014**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/US-West-Coast) | The method was the same as Global 2012, but with local sectors represented. | The reference point was calculated in the the same way as Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2012.

[**Ecuador - Gulf of Guayaquil 2015**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/Ecuador) | Similar to Global 2013-2015. Value added (VA) was added as a measure of local economies, ie. earnings of each sector. | The temporal reference point was the Value Added by each sector in 2007. |  Value added was used to replace GDP, which is more appropriate as measure of national economies. 
[**China 2015**](http://ohi-science.org/assessment/China) | Status model is the same as in global assessments| The spatial reference point is the maximum revenue across all regions over all years. | Data on revenue generated from each marine sector is not available, and thus total revenue from all sectors are used for the assessment.
