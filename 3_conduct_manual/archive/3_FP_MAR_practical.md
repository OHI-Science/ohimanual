### **MARICULTURE**
#### Practical Considerations

#### Recommendations for your assessment

Setting the reference point for mariculture really depends on regional preferences. This can be very hard to do: in best cases you would incorporate the potential range for mariculture based on habitat suitability for each cultured species, distance from the coast as well as which habitat is suitable, and how much local preference wants to allot to mariculture (versus area apportioned to ports, hotels, beaches, tourism, etc). In Global 2012, without information about social limitations for how much coastal area could be allotted to mariculture, we included the entire area of the coastline, thus assuming that mariculture could be developed everywhere. At a regional scale, better data will allow for restrictions based on habitat, conflicting uses, and social preferences.

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally, there would be information on the area available for mariculture - physically and/or based on social expectations and priorities - and the sustainability of the mariculture practices. This would mean that assessments had been made to identify the physical coastal and offshore habitat appropriate for each intended type of mariculture species (example: offshore habitats for finfish and shallower habitats for filter-feeding invertebrates) and the areas that have been identified as socially appropriate, since mariculture competes for space with many other ocean uses, including fishing and tourism activities. This approach would not penalize regions that have less geographic area available for mariculture, though places with fewer sheltered bays or lower primary production could be at a disadvantage. The type of reference point used will depend on the data available.
