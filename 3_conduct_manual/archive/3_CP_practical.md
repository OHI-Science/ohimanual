####Practical Considerations

> **Coastal Protection** aims to assess the amount of protection provided by marine and coastal habitats against flooding and erosion to coastal areas that people value.

#### *Ideal Approach*

Ideally, data for all habitats within a region would be available, as well as information on the value of the land and the vulnerability of inhabitants being protected by these habitats. This requires data for habitat type at high spatial resolution  as well as a measure of the value of what is protected by the habitats. The reference point for habitat-based goals will likely be a temporal baseline; this means that historic data are needed such that current habitat and value data can be compared to them.

#### Ready to start on **Coastal Protection**?

 The areas relevant to this goal include both inhabited places, such as homes and other structures, and uninhabited places such as parks and special places. At local and regional scales data may exist on all these variables at a high enough resolution to map and calculate exactly which habitats are providing how much protection to which coastal areas. You must first decide which data sources to use for your maps. Do you have spatially-explicit satellite data? If so, how far back in time does it go? The data consideration will be a consideration when you set the reference points.

> In the U.S. West Coast assessment (2014), researchers went to the local public library to find hand-drawn maps of historical sand-dunes in California, for example, in order to find information for sand dune extent in the 1850s.

In addition, one might want to know the level of vulnerability of the different coastal communities. Vulnerability can be quantified as the ability to evacuate, fragility of constructions, economic ability to reconstruct in case of damage. The the reason this is done is to prioritize the protection of certain locations. Physical properties may be available in regional studies, allowing for more a detailed understanding of the protective ability, and likelihood of exposure for each habitat type in different portions of the coastline.

As with the other habitat-based goals (See **Best Approaches**), you will need to make careful decisions about your reference point. It's an important decision to be made based on good science given the limitations of available data. The reference point is the extent of the habitat at some time in the past, in other words the ideal condition. You will need historical data for this--either from satellites, published papers, or even hand-drawn maps. For questions of sustainability, you must consider, what is a good year to set as your historical past extent? Do you want to be ambitious and set it far in the past, so it gets closer to a more "pristine" condition? Or do you want to make it represent human use? Will it make your scores look better or worse if you choose a more recent or more distant example?

Q: what are we protecting against?
A: erosion, storm damage. We did spend a lot of time trying to think about the value of the land/people behind the habitats. PNAS paper looking at the US accounting for # of people on the land and the value of the land for coastal habitats. It gets challenging bc uninhabited is important too. Property value is weird because it is a measure of rich people--so we decided what is on land: just focus on what the habitats are and the protection they provide.
At the regional level, could start thinking about these issues (globally there also weren’t the data), but it’s not super democratic--property values and rich people, and uninhabited areas are valuable as well.
