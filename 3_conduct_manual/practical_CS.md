### Carbon storage

Highly productive coastal wetland ecosystems store substantially larger amount of carbon than terrestrial forests and have the highest sequestration rates of any habitats on earth. They are also threatened by under-regulated coastal development but are amenable to restoration and conservation efforts. This goal intends to capture **the ability of the coastal habitats to remove carbon given their carbon updtake rate and health conditions**. A score of 100 means all habitats that contribute to carbon removal are still intact or have been restored and they can function to their full carbon burial potential.

>Habitat-based goals should be considered together during the data gathering process because the same data underly three goals: **Carbon Storage**, **Coastal Protection**, and **Biodiversity**. Goal models to date have depended on the area (square kilometers) of each habitat type in each region, the condition of each habitat, and a weighting to distinguish how different habitats contribute to each goal.

**_Ideal Approach_**

Ideally, you will know which habitats contribute to carbon _sequestration and storage_, and their _capacity_ to do so. You will also have information on _habitat extent_ and _health_ conditions. The reference point for habitat-based goals will likely be temporal, meaning you will compare the current area of these habitats to some area in the past, and thus historic data are needed. Reference points could also be set by with a proportion increase (or decrease) of known conditions.

**Practical Guidance**

In terms of habitat types for this goal, it is recommended to search for _mangroves, saltmarshes_, and _seagrasses_ because these are viewed as carbon-sequestering habitats that are both ecologically threatened and sensitive to policy responses. It is possible that there are other carbon-sequestering habitats present in your study area. But you should remember that we recommend using habitats that can store carbon on the order of 100 years, thereby limiting the types of habitat types you will need. _To see how to obtain data on habitat extent and condition, read section on **Biodiversity sub-goal: Habitats**_.

_Contribution_ is relative contribution of each habitat to total carbon storage, measured by the per area, empirical rates of carbon uptake and coverage area. For this you would have to search the literature and find ratios of organic nutrient uptake between habitats, and you would have to make sure these studies represent your study area. For example, were the studies done with a young mangrove forest, or an older one, which might have different growth rates?

>Understanding habitat carbon storage rates is an area of ongoing research. The capacity for habitats to store carbon varies, and depends on the morphology of plants in the system. In the global assessment, we assumed equal potential for carbon storage by each habitat, and thus contribution to carbon storage is measured by habitat extents directly.


**_Examples of the Approach_**

Assessment | Developing the Model  | Setting the Reference Point | Other Considerations
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
**Global 2012** |  Seagrasses, tidal marshes and mangroves, were assessed. The whole extent of mangroves was included, including parts on land or in river deltas. The status was measured as a function of its current condition relative to a reference condition and a variable that weights the relative contribution of each habitat type to total carbon storage.  | Reference conditions were set as the current condition or area of coastal plant habitat coverage relative to that in ~1980. Relative contribution was measured as the amount of area each habitat covers relative to the total area covered by all three habitats given available data. | This was not a very ambitious reference point.
**Global 2013** | The goal model was the same as in Global 2012. Mangrove data included 1km inland in addition to 1km offshore.  | The reference point was the same as Global 2012. | There were improvements in data processing.
**Brazil (2014)** | The goal model was the same as in Global 2012. The greatest data gaps were for sea grasses. | Different reference points were set for each habitat. For salt marshes, the reference year was 1975; mangroves, 1980; salt marshes, 1979 - 1981. Estimations were used to retroactively determine the reference condition for mangroves and salt marshes. | The same approach was used as in Global 2012, with local data used as available.
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | Salt marshes and seagrass beds were considered. Extent was used and habitat health was not used. | Temporal reference points were set for each habitat. For salt marshes, the percentage of pre-industrialized habitat coverage; for sand dunes, the habitat extent between the 1950s and 1960s. | The study required reconstructions of historic habitat extents in order to set more ambitious targets.
