# Introduction to Informing Decision-Making

Informing decision making with the findings of your OHI assessment is perhaps the most sensitive phase of the process because of political and social implications, as well as potential consequences for particular stakeholder groups. Prior to the publication of the findings, the convener should host a workshop to present the findings of the assessment to the stakeholders who have participated in the process, so they understand the methods employed, the reference points used, sources of data and information, etc. This is an opportunity for them to ask questions to experts, clarify facts, and provide initial feedback to the technical team. Likewise, the experts can use this as an opportunity to present their preliminary recommendations based on the findings. 

Following this initial consultation period, the convener and the technical team should prepare a detailed report of the OHI+ assessment detailing the following (but not limited to):

- Purpose of the assessment: policy and management needs
- Description of the entire process, including the role of various stakeholders
- Description of the study area and rationale for selection of spatial boundaries
- Description of the methods:
 - Goal model choice, including rationale and alternatives with ideal data sources
 - Reference point, including rationale and alternatives with ideal data sources
 - Data layers for status, pressures, and resilience
- Description of the methodology and tools used
- Description of the scores and explanation of the variables leading to the scores
- Results of management scenarios tests (if conducted â€” see sections below)
- Spatial and thematic recommendations based on identified priorities
- Identified data gaps and recommendations for collecting the necessary information for future assessments
- Management intervention recommendations

Should stakeholders decide to go beyond simply obtaining a report with recommendations, the OHI process should continue into a consensus building exercise aimed at reaching and implementing agreements over the short-to-medium term.
