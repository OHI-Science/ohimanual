## Outreach and Communications Strategy

It is important to have a clear communications strategy for how you will communicate the results of your assessment to your various audiences. You will want to tailor your message and platform to your various audiences, choosing the tools that will best suit your objective or call to action for each group. In order to do this, it is helpful to revisit your stakeholders analysis and identify key messages and recommendations that are relevant to relevant to each group.

In terms of influencing policy change, in addition to highlighting key findings of specific geographies and goals, it is important to **provide recommendations to decision-makers and managers about interventions and policies that can help improve goal scores.**

Keeping this in mind, you must then develop your communications and outreach strategy.

Your strategy will consist of both the creation of materials to communicate the findings of the assessment as well as an outreach plan that details how you will position yourself with your various audiences to gain leverage.

### Communications Strategy

The following materials will be needed to influence decision making:

 -	Summary of findings: present paper findings to wider audience, press, managers, and various decision-makers

 -	Policy paper/report/memos: provide recommendations to key decision-makers. Provide clear recommendations on data and knowledge gaps, priority geographies and themes, and management interventions to address pressures and resilience

 -	Website: in local language(s) and English (optional). For this, we have developed an free website publisher tool for you to use. If you are interested in using this template, please contact programs@oceanhealthindex.org.

 -	Fact-sheets & printed materials

### Outreach Strategy**

Examples of how to increase your presence include:

*	Stakeholder workshops and/or town hall meetings: present findings, develop a strategic plan of next steps, evaluate different management scenarios.

*	Work with network of decision-makers who were part of the planning team to organize public meetings, hearing, inter-agency meetings

*	Consider perspective of the decision-maker: clarify issue and why of interest, highlight action to take and the relevant science to support the action

*	Maintain engagement in the decision-making process: councils, partnerships with stakeholders, periodic meetings with technical working groups and government agencies

*	Provide clear recommendations and courses of actions that create the conditions to sustainable maximize ocean productivity

*	Clearly articulate geographic priorities and sectorial problems affecting local oceans

*	Be available to support ocean and coastal resource management planning and/or policy development processes
