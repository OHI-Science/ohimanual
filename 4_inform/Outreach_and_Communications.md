# Outreach and Communications Strategy

It is important to have a clear strategy for how to communicate the results of your assessment to your various audiences. You will want to have a clear message and way to reach to your various audiences, choosing the tools that will best suit your objective or call to action for each audience. To do this, it is helpful to revisit your initial assessment plan and stakeholder analysis and identify key messages and recommendations that are relevant to each group.

Your strategy will consist of both communication materials and a strategic outreach plan that details how you will distribute findings and materials.

In addition to highlighting key findings of specific geographies and goals, it can be important to provide interpretation of results and recommendations to decision-makers and managers so they can create policies to increase goal scores and ultimately ocean health.

## Communications Strategy

The following materials may be useful to you:

-	**Summary of findings**: findings to general audience, press, managers, and various decision-makers (via email or printed materials)

-	**Policy paper/report/memos**: interpretation and recommendations to key decision-makers, including information and knowledge gaps, priority geographies and themes, and management interventions

-	**Website**: broader distribution of findings and materials. Contact programs at oceanhealthindex.org to discuss options for using an OHI template

-	**Peer-reviewed academic manuscripts**

## Outreach Strategy

Examples of how to increase your presence include:

-	**Stakeholder workshops and/or town hall meetings**: present findings, develop a strategic plan of next steps, evaluate different management scenarios.

-	**Work with network of decision-makers** who were part of the planning team to organize public meetings, hearing, inter-agency meetings

-	**Consider perspective of the decision-maker**: clarify issue and why of interest, highlight action to take and the relevant science to support the action

-	**Maintain engagement in the decision-making process**: councils, partnerships with stakeholders, periodic meetings with technical working groups and government agencies

-	**Provide clear recommendations and courses of actions** that create the conditions to sustainable maximize ocean productivity

-	**Clearly articulate geographic priorities and sectorial problems** affecting local oceans

-	**Be available to support** ocean and coastal resource management planning and/or policy development processes
