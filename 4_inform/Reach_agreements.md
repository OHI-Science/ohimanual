## Reach agreements between stakeholders, and implement agreements

Based on the findings of management scenario testing, stakeholders and decision-makers can now focus on achieving a shared vision. At this stage individual stakeholders are empowered to make contributions towards reaching agreements by: focusing on interests and not positions, establishing objective criteria, and proposing options for mutual gain. A skilled convener can prove very useful in this stage of the process, as this is where stakeholders will explore options for improving the current status of ocean health.

Some potential options for reaching agreements at this stage are:

- focus solely on identifying broadly supported priority management actions and monitoring progress; or
- focus on monitoring progress only; let potential implementers determine priority actions independent of integrated stakeholder dialogue

Once the scope has been determined, the stakeholders must reach agreements of what will be accomplished. “A consensus agreement is one that all participants can accept or ‘live with’” (CBI). It is ideal that there is strong support for the agreement from all stakeholders. But it is not necessary that all stakeholders strongly support all elements of the agreement to reach a consensus based decision. Some possible agreements may include (but not limited to):

- Fisheries catch limits, gear bans, close seasons, quota systems\
- Adopting mariculture best practices
- Increasing access to resources for artisanal fisher peoples
- Regulations on the harvesting and trader of some natural products
- Coastal habitat protection and restoration
- Policies for increasing wages of ocean dependent workers, incentive ocean economies
- Sustainable tourism practices, tourism taxes
- Increasing area and management of protected areas and key species
- Increasing waste management facilities, water treatment, reduce runoff
- Protection of key habitats and management plans for sensitive endangered species

Each agreement reached should be described in detail, considering potential implications for specific groups that may be negatively affected by the decision, costs incurred, specific roles and responsibilities of stakeholders involved, and timeline for the implementation. Objective criteria for monitoring progress towards the agreements should be established, taking into consideration any resources necessary.

In many cases stakeholder agreements must be approved by regulatory agencies or elected officials, in which case, all proposed recommendations should be organized in a document highlighting the benefits and costs of each agreement. It is recommended stakeholders meet periodically to review progress made towards joint agreements, which also promotes greater trust and collaboration among individuals and organizations
