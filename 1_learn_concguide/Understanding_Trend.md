## **Understanding Trend**

The trend is calculated as the slope of the change in status based on recent data. As such, the trend calculation is not trying to predict the future but only to indicate the likely condition based on a linear relationship.

The trend is in most cases the trend in the last five years of data. The exact number of most recent years can change depending on the data sources, but the general idea is that the trend conveys the recent history of the indicator. It does this because the trend is then used to calculate the likely near-term future state and can show a reaction to policy interventions.
