## **Carbon Storage**

> **Carbon Storage** describes how much carbon is stored in natural coastal ecosystems that absorb and sequester it in large amounts.

#### Philosophy

**Carbon Storage** evaluates the status (extent and condition) of coastal marine habitats with high carbon storage capacity. In this case, "storage" means carbon sequestration. Highly productive coastal wetland ecosystems, like mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass beds, have substantially larger areal carbon burial rates than terrestrial forests. Coastal habitats therefore play a significant role in mitigating global carbon levels, and the health of these habitats is important because their destruction also releases large quantities of carbon into the atmosphere, damaging the overall health of coupled marine systems and exacerbating the impacts of global climate change.

> Though they form less than 2% of the ocean’s surface, coastal ecosystems contribute more to long-term carbon storage and sequestration in sediments than any other ocean ecosystem.

 Our focus here is on coastal habitats, so-called "Blue Carbon", because they have large potential to store carbon without causing acidification, and, contrary to open oceans, they provide a carbon storage service that can be affected by human actions such as conservation, and restoration efforts.

> The 2012 Global Assessment focuses on three ecosystems — mangroves, tidal marshes, and seagrasses — for their ability to store and sequester carbon in their plants and soils. When destroyed or degraded, these ecosystems not only stop sequestering carbon but can release the carbon stored in the sediment.

#### Ideal Approach

Use information about the coverage area and some measure of quality of all carbon storing habitats in the study area. For example, you could have data for both the spatial coverage of a mangrove and know its tree density. Additionally, different weights would be assigned to the habitats based on their relative ability to store carbon (i.e their carbon sequestration rates). The carbon storage model can incorporate such weights once they are available in a similar way to the methods developed for the coastal protection goal. The reference point for habitat-based goals will likely be a temporal comparison with a historic extent or state; this means that historic data are needed such that current habitat extent data can be compared to them.

> TIP: The relative carbon storage abilities for different habitats is an area of active research.

#### Keep in Mind

Even though the pelagic oceanic plays a large role in the sequestration of anthropogenic carbon, by acting as a large carbon sink, the mechanisms for open ocean carbon storage cannot be managed locally or regionally as there are no practical methods for intervention or manipulation. On top of that, the storage of global carbon in ocean water leads to its acidification, which has negative consequences for marine life.

Because they store carbon for less than one hundred years, seaweeds and corals were not included in the **Carbon Storage** goal in the Global Assessments. While the pelagic oceanic carbon sink, consisting of phytoplankton, plays a large role in the sequestration of anthropogenic carbon, the pelagic ocean mechanisms are not amenable to local or regional management intervention. Phytoplankton contribute to carbon fixation when they die and sink to the sea bottom at sufficient depth, because it is effectively out of circulation. However, if those phytoplankton are eaten, the carbon is cycled back into the system and not sequestered.

Something that could potentially be included in the **Carbon Storage** goal in the future is mollusc shells, if they are added extracted and not recycled in the sea. So, if information on mariculture production and waste disposal are available, this could be an interesting addition to carbon storage at a regional scale.
