## Overview of the OHI+ WebApp

>**OHI+ WebApps** are websites created to facilitate independent assessments, and one is available for nearly every coastal nation or territory. WebApps are fully customizable and display key information relevant to your assessment: input data layers, output scores, and maps. Each WebApp comes preloaded with each country's data used for the Global Assessment, which is divided at subnational (e.g. states, provinces, regions, etc.). Do notice that the default information in the WebApps is for demonstration purposes only. Only after you conduct your indenepdent assessment, you will be able to use your WebApp to help inform decision-making.

When using the WebApp, you can conduct a preliminary assessment and use the built-in functions to compare input layers,  output scores, and change data display options. You will return to the WebApp at the end of the OHI+ process when your team has finalized the calculation methods.

OHI+ WebApps will be very useful for all stages of planning your assessment. The WebApp can be used to **Learn** because it allows for exploration of how the Index works--your team and planning partners can learn what data look like, what map regions are being considered, and ultimately, your team will be able to see how all of the information gathered in your OHI+ assessment will come together. For this reason, the WebApps can be used for **Planning** because they are a communication platform for an assessment team, since information is presented in a manner that is accessible to group members of different disciplines and technical capacities. They will also be kept in mind in the **Conduct** phase, as can be used to set data gathering or goal model development priorities for your assessment. In the final **Communicate** phase, the data outputs from your WebApp will be invaluable as you share your assessment’s data and calculated scores once you have finalized and formatted your data and modified goal models.  

## How you will use the WebApp

The WebApps are available through http://ohi-science.org using a three-letter identifier in the URL. For example, Ecuador’s WebApp ("ECU") is found at http://ohi-science.org/ecu. When first exploring a WebApp (for example, http://ohi-science.org/ecu), note that it is possible to **translate** the site into any language that Google provides using the pull-down menu at the top. This will help communication among your team and will facilitate collaboration with partners and stakeholders. You can use the OHI+ WebApp to help in the planning of your assessment in these initial phases. More importantly, however, it will be useful in the **Conduct** phase when you identify your regions and local priorities, and begin preparing your data, and documenting the decisions that are occurring throughout the process.

> Each WebApp displays data layers, which are raw data in this case, as well as the calculated OHI scores based on information extracted from global assessments. As such, they do not provide fine-scale resolution of data for each coastal nation or territory: the scores and data on which they are based are a starting point for an assessment to be conducted by an independent group. These data can be used as a default if better data for the region do not exist, but we encourage you to replace them wherever possible.
