## **Determine the Need and Purpose of Conducting Your OHI+ Assessment**

> Remember that producing the Index is not the end in itself--the  aim is to *achieving improved ocean health.*

OHI+ is applied research, aiming at solving practical problems related to ocean and coastal resource management. One of your first tasks when developing an OHI+ assessment should be to define the purpose of the study and think about how it can complement other or planned efforts of environmental management. Assessments should be conducted with clear research questions in mind--*how will the assessment help achieve improved ocean health? How will the assessment help address specific problems and needs in the study area?*

Carefully choosing the study area and the regions to evaluate in the assessment certainly plays an important role in defining the purpose of the study. When defining the spatial scales of the assessment, consider the following: Will your regions match the scales of decision-making, will they match biogeography, or will they try to fit both? Will this require new data, or will it require involvement and the collaboration of neighboring countries?

* See [the Baltic Health Index](http://www.su.se/ostersjocentrum/english/baltic-eye/research/baltic-health-index) for an example of regional collaboration.

Once you have a sense of your regions of interest, you should also consider whether other efforts are already underway to manage those areas and whether researchers are active in the area. This could lead to new opportunities for collaboration, and for chances support new data-collection efforts. You should aim to align your OHI+ assessment with existing management objectives and initiatives to reduce redundancy and maximize the utility of existing resources. As you begin planning the assessment, do consider the policy and scientific strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of conducting a study your area.

> When conducting an OHI+ assessment, remember that the process is just as important as the results.

Defining the end-goals of the study will largely determine how goal models, data gathering, and reference points are developed to maximize the utility of the findings to inform decision-making, and is very important in ensuring a smooth and successful project with OHI+.

#### Some things to consider in this step of the process:
- Do some preliminary scoping - is this feasible in the desired context?
- Begin thinking of the objectives, scope, scale, and key actors to involve in the process; this will make Phase 2 much easier to tackle.
- Understand which goals and ocean benefits are important in the proposed study area, and what threats or possible changes might be affecting the sustainable delivery of those benefits
