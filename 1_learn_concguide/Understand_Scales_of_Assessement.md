## **Understand the scales of assessment**

![Scores are calculated for each region and combined to produce a total score for the study area. Data or indicators are required for every region.](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1RsamVf-p5nSUS8_w--uU5I2717tqMPlhc3JEbW8Rvkg/pub?w=677&h=446)

### The Global assessment and your OHI+

> Your assessment will be an example of an Ocean Health Index+ (OHI+) assessment.

Your assessment will be an example of an OHI+ assessment. OHI+ assessments are conducted by independent groups such as yours that use the Index framework to measure ocean health in their own regions, countries, states, and communities. Your OHI+ assessment is different from the Global Assessments because they are meant to fit your local context. The purpose of conducting these independent assessments is that they be used by managers in your area to incorporate information and priorities at the spatial scale where policy and management decisions are made.

The Index framework remains consistent at different scales. Whether at the global level, as in the Global Assessments, or at your more local level, the goal scores are calculated at the scale of the reporting unit, or **region**, and scores are then combined using a weighted average to produce the score for the overall area assessed, called the **study area**.

> In the Global Assessments the **study area** is the world and the **regions** assessed are two hundred twenty-one coastal countries or territories, as well as Antartica in another study and the fifteen regions of the High Seas in an even more recent study. Regions are defined by Exclusive Economic Zones. Antarctica, and the high seas (fifteen sub divisions). Global assessments are conducted by a multidisciplinary team of scientists led by the U.S. National Center for Ecological Assessment and Synthesis (NCEAS), Conservation International, and the Seas Around Us Project. These studies are published annually and use models developed using the best existing data available a the global scale to capture each goal philosophy.

#### Comparing Scales of Assessment

> The overarching OHI framework should guide your efforts, but you should determine the data, models, and other inputs that go into it.

It is important to note that the scores form you OHI+ assessment can't be compared directly to the scores from Global Assessments. Your goal choices, goal models, and input data should be different, which means that your methods will be unique to your area. However, you can compare the scores for the same assessment area through time and make truly quantitative comparisons. Understanding this should allow you to be creative as you develop your plans going into your assessment.

> Even in the Global Assessments, the methods are improved every year by increasing goal model robustness, integrating new data, and recalculating the scores with the improved methods both for the current year and, retroactively, for previous years to allow for year-to-year comparisons. The scientific objectivity comes from applying the same methods and reference points to all regions equally, which also allows for valid comparison of performance across countries.
