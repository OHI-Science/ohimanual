## **What is the Ocean Health Index?**

The Ocean Health Index scores important **Goals** of ocean health. The Ocean Health Index defines a healthy ocean as one that can sustainably deliver a range of benefits to people now and in the future, while not compromising the state of the oceans and coasts. A healthy ocean in this definition, however, is not necessarily a pristine ocean, although the Index allows for pristine systems as well as sustainably used systems to score highly. In fewer words, the OHI is about balancing priorities.

<!---From Steve's post--->
Scores reflect how well coastal regions optimize their potential ocean benefits and services in a sustainable way. A score of 100 means that the evaluated system achieved its defined target for that goal and is sustainably delivering all of the specified benefits and is likely to continue doing so in the near future. A score of 0 means that global data were available, but that the country either did not achieve any of the available benefits or that the benefits it did obtain were gained in an unsustainable manner.

Because the Index compares scores against the available data within the scope of a given study area, it presents a highly tailorable framework and can match an assessment's geographic scope. It is a structured approach, but the structure may change appropriately with each new interpretation.

> A flexible framework such as the OHI allows assessments to adapt to local context while still being broadly comparable across regions.

The OHI framework is distinct from the organization of the data that go into it. The framework itself is structured around defined ocean-derived **goals** coupled with findings of the **likely future state**, **pressures** and **resilience**. The inputs to the framework consist of the data and indicators used in the assessment and the goal models developed based the local context. In this way, the scores are calculated using the best available data and indicators at the scale of the assessment.

> Outside partners are now using the OHI framework to conduct their own independent assessments, called Ocean Health Index+ (OHI+) assessments. OHI+ assessments are interpretations of the original Global Assessments conducted for the first time in 2012 (Halpern *et al.* 2012). The methods have improved since then, and researchers have changed the goals, models, and data in their assessments in an ever-evolving process that characterizes the Index.

If you are conducting an independent assessment, this **Conceptual Guide** will help you understand the reasoning behind the framework, and will allow you to prepare to make use of local information to get the best results possible.

The benefits provided by the ocean have been measured through these broadly held public goals which are applicable across all geographies:

- [**Food provision**](FP_Philosophy) from sustainably harvested or cultured stocks
- [**Artisanal opportunities**](AO_Philosophy) for local communities from sustainable practices
- [**Natural products**](NP_Philosophy), including pharmaceuticals and decorative materials, that are sustainably extracted
- [**Carbon storage**](CS_Philosophy) in coastal habitats
- [**Coastal protection**](CP_Philosophy) from inundation and erosion
- [**Sense of place**](SP_Philosophy) from culturally valued iconic species, habitats, and landscapes
- [**Livelihoods and economies**](LE_Philosophy) from coastal and ocean-dependent communities
- [**Tourism and recreation**](TR_Philosophy) opportunities
- [**Clean waters**](CW_Philosophy) and beaches for aesthetic and health values
- [**Biodiversity**](BIO_Philosophy) of species and habitats

## **Understand the scales of assessment**

![Scores are calculated for each region and combined to produce a total score for the study area. Data or indicators are required for every region.](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1RsamVf-p5nSUS8_w--uU5I2717tqMPlhc3JEbW8Rvkg/pub?w=677&h=446)

### The Global assessment and your OHI+

> Your assessment will be an example of an Ocean Health Index+ (OHI+) assessment.

Your assessment will be an example of an OHI+ assessment. OHI+ assessments are conducted by independent groups such as yours that use the Index framework to measure ocean health in their own regions, countries, states, and communities. Your OHI+ assessment is different from the Global Assessments because they are meant to fit your local context. The purpose of conducting these independent assessments is that they be used by managers in your area to incorporate information and priorities at the spatial scale where policy and management decisions are made.

The Index framework remains consistent at different scales. Whether at the global level, as in the Global Assessments, or at your more local level, the goal scores are calculated at the scale of the reporting unit, or **region**, and scores are then combined using a weighted average to produce the score for the overall area assessed, called the **study area**.

> In the Global Assessments the **study area** is the world and the **regions** assessed are two hundred twenty-one coastal countries or territories, as well as Antartica in another study and the fifteen regions of the High Seas in an even more recent study. Regions are defined by Exclusive Economic Zones. Antarctica, and the high seas (fifteen sub divisions). Global assessments are conducted by a multidisciplinary team of scientists led by the U.S. National Center for Ecological Assessment and Synthesis (NCEAS), Conservation International, and the Seas Around Us Project. These studies are published annually and use models developed using the best existing data available a the global scale to capture each goal philosophy.

#### Comparing Scales of Assessment

> The overarching OHI framework should guide your efforts, but you should determine the data, models, and other inputs that go into it.

It is important to note that the scores form you OHI+ assessment can't be compared directly to the scores from Global Assessments. Your goal choices, goal models, and input data should be different, which means that your methods will be unique to your area. However, you can compare the scores for the same assessment area through time and make truly quantitative comparisons. Understanding this should allow you to be creative as you develop your plans going into your assessment.

> Even in the Global Assessments, the methods are improved every year by increasing goal model robustness, integrating new data, and recalculating the scores with the improved methods both for the current year and, retroactively, for previous years to allow for year-to-year comparisons. The scientific objectivity comes from applying the same methods and reference points to all regions equally, which also allows for valid comparison of performance across countries.

## Overview of the OHI+ WebApp

>In this section, you will get an introduction to the OHI WebApps. When using the WebApp, you can conduct a preliminary assessment and use the built-in functions to compare input layers,  output scores, and change data display options. You will return to the WebApp at the end of the OHI+ process when your team has finalized the calculation methods.

OHI+ WebApps will be very useful for all stages of planning your assessment. The WebApp can be used to **Learn** because it allows for exploration of how the Index works--your team and planning partners can learn what data look like, what map regions are being considered, and ultimately, your team will be able to see how all of the information gathered in your OHI+ assessment will come together. For this reason, the WebApps can be used for **Planning** because they are a communication platform for an assessment team, since information is presented in a manner that is accessible to group members of different disciplines and technical capacities. They will also be kept in mind in the **Conduct** phase, as can be used to set data gathering or goal model development priorities for your assessment. In the final **Communicate** phase, the data outputs from your WebApp will be invaluable as you share your assessment’s data and calculated scores once you have finalized and formatted your data and modified goal models.  

## How you will use the WebApp

**OHI+ WebApps** are websites created to facilitate independent assessments, and one is available for nearly every coastal nation or territory. The WebApps are available through http://ohi-science.org using a three-letter identifier in the URL. For example, Ecuador’s WebApp ("ECU") is found at http://ohi-science.org/ecu. When first exploring a WebApp (for example, http://ohi-science.org/ecu), note that it is possible to **translate** the site into any language that Google provides using the pull-down menu at the top. This will help communication among your team and will facilitate collaboration with partners or stakeholders. You can use the OHI+ WebApp to scope out the planning of your assessment in these initial phases. More importantly, however, it will be useful in the **Conduct** phase when you identify your regions and local priorities, and begin preparing your data, and documenting the decisions that are occurring throughout the process.

![The WebApp start page. Note that it's possible to translate the page into your language of choice.](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/11Gojqw0Xz4kUo_uM1Y699EKO3qN_dae0w93ICzXJ2Pg/pub?w=960&h=720)

> Each WebApp displays data layers, which are raw data in this case, as well as the calculated OHI scores based on information extracted from global assessments. As such, they do not provide fine-scale resolution of data for each coastal nation or territory: the scores and data on which they are based are a starting point for an assessment to be conducted by an independent group. These data can be used as a default if better data for the region do not exist, but we encourage you to replace them wherever possible.

## **Determine the Need and Purpose of Conducting Your OHI+ Assessment**

> Remember that producing the Index is not the end in itself--the  aim is to *achieving improved ocean health.*

OHI+ is applied research, aiming at solving practical problems related to ocean and coastal resource management. One of your first tasks when developing an OHI+ assessment should be to define the purpose of the study and think about how it can complement other or planned efforts of environmental management. Assessments should be conducted with clear research questions in mind--*how will what you are doing help achieve improved ocean health? How will it solve the problems you want to solve?*

One clear way to think about this is in choosing your study area and the regions that will comprise it. Will your regions match the scales of decision-making, will they match biogeography, or will they try to fit both? Will this require new data, or will it require involvement and the collaboration of neighboring countries?

* See [the Baltic Health Index](http://www.su.se/ostersjocentrum/english/baltic-eye/research/baltic-health-index) for an example of regional collaboration.

Once you have a sense of your regions of interest, you should also consider whether other efforts are already underway to manage those areas and whether researchers are active in the area. This could lead to new opportunities for collaboration, and for chances support new data-collection efforts. You should Identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in your area on both the scientific and the policy scale where possible.

> When conducting an OHI+ assessment, remember that the process is just as important as the results.

Defining the end-goals of the study will largely determine how goal models, data gathering, and reference points are developed to maximize the utility of the findings to inform decision-making, and is very important in ensuring a smooth and successful project with OHI+.

***

##**Why Ten Goals?**

The Index did not set out to have ten goals. The process of reviewing literature and assessing management objectives resulted in ten goals, several with sub-goals that are each assessed separately. Regions in which some goals are not relevant can (and should) be assessed based only on the remaining goals. The Index is flexible to the inclusion of different or additional goals, something we have not yet encountered but is certainly possible.

###Changing Goal Models

Although the Index framework provides guidelines on how to adapt underlying models to available regional data, using simpler models or different proxies when necessary, it cannot prescribe which available regional data sets are preferred, or dictate the most appropriate models to use or choices of reference points, proxy data or goal weights. These decisions require involving local experts within the region to provide opinions and direction towards an outcome most representative of ocean health in the study area.

The Index can also accommodate additional goals if they better reflect what local communities value, although we feel that the ten goals currently defined within the Index are sufficiently broad to capture a vast majority of values. No indicator is exempt from such subjective decisions. The Index’s framework, however, requires one to document and track such assumptions explicitly and thus, contrary to many other existing indices, allows for careful assessment of the sensitivity of results to such decisions.

## **How are the goals weighted?**

The goals are currently weighted equally in OHI calculations. However, in your OHI+ assessment the weighting can be changed depending on your local context. Stakeholders may have differing priorities, but when presented with the portfolio of goals used in the Ocean Health Index, these differences can become less pronounced, as was found in a study by Halpern *et al.* (2013) in *Marine Policy*. This would require good data, of course, such as the information collected through a representatively sample survey.

## **How is the Index calculated?**

For each goal, models are developed to best represent the philosophy of that goal using the best available data at the scale of study. The present status that is calculated individually for each goal forms half of that goal’s score.  The other half, called likely future status, is based on three things:

•	the **Trend**, which is the average rate of change for status during the most recent five years

•	the total **Pressures** that will harm future benefits

•	the total **Resilience** actions that can reduce pressures and maintain or raise future benefits (for example treaties, laws, enforcement, habitat protection)

![](./Figures/Trend_Pressure_Resilience.png)

The current status of each goal is determined by comparing the most recent measure of the goal with a goal-specific sustainable **Reference Point**.

The trend is calculated as the slope of the change in status based on recent data. As such, the trend calculation is not trying to predict the future but only to indicate likely condition (sustainability) based on a linear relationship.
Pressures and resilience are ultimately important for scores, but they have a smaller contribution to the overall scores because we can only approximate their effects. Individual pressures are ranked for their importance to different goals based on published studies and expert opinion. Resilience actions are the best way to improve a score, because they can reduce pressures, protect ocean habitats and species, improve status, and optimize benefits to people.
Status, trend, likely future status, pressures, and resilience are called ‘dimensions’ within the Ocean Health Index framework.

**In the figure below**, likely future state (in yellow) is the result of the current status modified by trend, minus the negative effect of pressures (grey), plus the positive effect of resilience (salmon pink).

![In the figure, likely future state (in yellow) is the result of the trend, minus the negative effect of pressures (grey), plus the positive effect of resilience (salmon pink)](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1GkLZnW8hQJf1KLX89LzViEBU4PkJ8kRqOERt_Fxtwu4/pub?w=864&h=384)

## **Reference points**

To assess how well a goal is being delivered, it is necessary to identify the target to which it will be compared. This target is called the reference point. In an Ocean Health Index framework, setting the reference point enables the numeric values relevant for each goal to be scaled between zero and one hundred (where one hundred means that the current status is equal to the target reference point, and zero means that it is as far from the target reference point as is possible). Sharing a common range for scores makes all goal scores comparable. The reference point may be a target value at some time in the past, a comparison with some other location (such as the best performing region), a target established by a treaty or other agreement, or---best of all---a target determined by a scientifically-informed input-output relationship (an equation called a **production function**).

It can be advantageous to translate a management goal to a maximization or minimization problem with an objective function so that it is clear exactly how an indicator should be developed to track progress. Indeed, these choices significantly influence the evaluation of a goal’s status. For instance, a sustainable seafood management goal could be measured in terms of yields if the goal is focused on maximizing food provision or in number of jobs if the goal is focused on maximizing social and economic welfare. These two goal framings would lead to the development of different targets in terms of both yields and level of employment. Where necessary, our conceptual framework encourages the reframing of management goals to ensure that the corresponding indicators, and the units in which they are reported, accurately portray the intent of the goal as it is stated.

It is important to understand that setting a reference point is a conscious choice. This choice can be informed by the literature and by expert advice, and can be discussed in terms of costs and benefits. However, ultimately there is no optimum and certainly not only one solution, and this can be very uncomfortable. This makes setting a reference point difficult, but even more important to define explicitly.

## **Understanding Status**

The status component of each goal is captured through a model that represents the philosophy of the goal in a way that produces findings that are most useful to inform decision-making at the scale of your assessment.

The current status of each goal is determined by comparing the most recent measure of the goal with a goal-specific sustainable reference point. For each goal, as well as for many individual data layers, values are rescaled to reference points, or targets, which serve as benchmarks based on SMART principles: Specific (to the management goal), Measurable, Ambition, Realistic, and Time-bound (Samhouri *et al.* 2012; Perrings *et al.* 2010; 2011).

## **Understanding Trend**

The trend is calculated as the slope of the change in status based on recent data. As such, the trend calculation is not trying to predict the future but only to indicate the likely condition based on a linear relationship.

The trend is in most cases the trend in the last five years of data. The exact number of most recent years can change depending on the data sources, but the general idea is that the trend conveys the recent history of the indicator. It does this because the trend is then used to calculate the likely near-term future state and can show a reaction to policy interventions.

## **Understanding Pressures**

A pressure is any kind of stressor on the social or ecological system that is harmful for ocean health.

Pressures can change how goals interact with each other. For example, raising fish in the **Mariculture** sub-goal can cause genetic escapes, which are a pressure on the **Wild-Caught Fisheries** and **Species** sub-goals. The genetic escapes do not affect mariculture itself, however, and have no effect on that particular sub-goal score while they do have a negative effect on the other sub-goal scores.

Pressures are calcuated as the sum of the ecological and social pressures that negatively affect goal scores. The Index framework calculates pressures by first grouping them into five ecological categories (pollution, habitat destruction, fishing pressure, species pollution, and climate change) and one social category. The reason there are categories is to minimize sampling bias, so that no one kind disproportionately influences the score. They are weighted equally in the global assessment, but in your local assessment they can be changed if there is enough information on how to do so.

## **Understanding Resilience**

> Ultimately, it is resilience that will help shape the future of ocean health.

#### Philosophy

A resilience measure can be a law, policy, or a given performance evaluation that speaks to the effectiveness of actions to improve ocean health. Resilience actions are the best way to improve a score for a country, because they can reduce pressures, protect ocean habitats and species, improve status, and optimize benefits to people. There are different categories of resilience, from institutional, to social, to ecological.

> Example: Coral reef organisms have very limited resilience to human-caused pressures.  Some individuals and species may tolerate environmental insults better than others, but no natural resilience can reduce such pressures.  Protective actions taken by people are a reef’s only ultimate source of resilience.  Humans don’t usually take such actions just to preserve a reef for its existence value, but also to safeguard the its flow of benefits to people, including food, ornamental fishes for aquariums, medical products, tourism and others.  So from the human perspective, preserving coral reefs is an expression of resilience.

As nation states arose, laws and regulations have steadily evolved to meet their needs. The UN’s main goal was to prevent another world war, but over time it has become the nucleus for international and planetary resilience through programs in peace and security, development, human rights, humanitarian affairs and international law. The UN also organizes treaties such as the  Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and programs such as the Millennium Development Goals and Sustainable Development Goals that aim to end poverty and hunger, build healthy lives and well-being, achieve gender equality and empower women and girls; ensure access to sustainable sources of water, sanitation, energy; reduce inequality; combat climate change; create safe and resilient cities and settlements; and use ocean and land sustainably.  Though such engagements are entirely voluntary, most countries participate, and the Ocean Health Index considers such participation in calculating resilience scores.

Physical manifestations of resilience also appeared, such as public works projects for worship, defense, transportation, water, sanitation and many others.

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally, assessments of social resilience would include national-level and as well as local rules and other relevant institutional mechanisms that are meant to safeguard ocean health. The global focus has been on international treaties and indices, so your region should have more localized information. There would also be information as to their effectiveness and enforcement. of more. Information on social norms and community (and other local-scale) institutions (such as tenure or use rights) that influence resource use and management would be useful too.

For each goal the Index measures several aspects of resilience. Ecological integrity is evaluated as the relative condition of assessed species in a given location and goal-specific regulations including laws and other institutional measures  that address ecological pressures. Social integrity dis measured as well and escribes the internal processes of a community that affect its resilience. Resilience is then calculated as the sum of the ecological factors and social initiatives (policies, laws, indicators of good governance, etc.) that can positively affect goal scores by reducing or eliminating pressures. This is because resilience in the Index framework acts to reduce pressures in each region. Therefore, resilience measures must not only be directly or indirectly relevant to ocean health, but must be in response to a pressure layer affecting a goal.

<!---PLACE. Social integrity differs among nations.  A nation’s successes or deficiencies affect both its own population and those of other nations, so projects have evolved to evaluate social aspects of resilience.  The Ocean Health Index assesses social integrity with information from the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI). WGI evaluates how well governments exercise powers to benefit citizens and, indirectly environmental quality by assessing freedom of expression and citizens’ ability to select their government; political stability; absence of violence and terrorism; government effectiveness; quality of regulations; extent to which the rule of law prevails; and extent of corruption The Index also uses other composite measures of resilience for particular goals, including the Travel and Tourism Competitive Index and the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) that evaluates a country’s competitiveness in achieving sustained economic prosperity.--->

<!---A WGI score of 1 means that social integrity is the best it can be; and a score of 0 means that governance is completely ineffective, so that the country has no social Resilience.  The full composite score for all six WGI indicators is used to evaluate social resilience for all of the Ocean Health Index goals except for Livelihoods; the Livelihoods goal only uses the WGI’s Regulatory Quality data layer, because it also uses the Global Competitiveness Index, which duplicates, but improves, the remaining WGI layers for this purpose.--->

#### Keep in Mind

Although resilience really should be judged by the effectiveness of its outcome, this is not possible at the global level.  Therefore nations are given advanced credit for signing treaties, e.g., for conserving biodiversity or eliminating trade in endangered species, and for measures of social integrity.  The assumption is that results from those beneficial actions and conditions will become visible in following years as increased scores for goal status and trend

## **Interactions: Pressures and Resilience**

Pressures and resilience layers interact with an indicator to increase or decrease its likely future state. The real-world goal of having resilience measures is to lead to an increase in the likely future state, although this can also be achieved through a decrease in the pressures as well. Either way, the most desired outcome for any goal is intended to improve the overall score. This would be most visible through multiple years of engagement with an OHI assessment.

Ecological and social resilience are assessed separately and then combined to determine the goal score. This is usually  done with equal weighting, but that could be changed if expert opinion recommended otherwise. Any new resilience measure must be associated with a pressures layer regardless of the weighting, such that, ideally, any pressure on the environment has a countervailing mitigation action. The assessment will use this relationship, and the underlying data, to ultimately convey which is more effective.

**The figure below** shows stressors by category, and the resilience measures meant to 'balance' (or counteract) them for the global assessment. Note that resilience layers are only available for some categories and goals in the Global case, highlighting the importance of data availability for these layers. Also, some resilience measures are goal-specific; that is, they act on certain goals without counteracting pressures. When you have regulations to improve the practices captured in the status specific goals (e.g., sustainable tourism, lower bycatch, etc.), you can include them as resilience measures.

![Each resilience data layer should have a corresponding pressures layer, and vice versa. Note that a pressure layer becomes (1-resilience) in cases where only resilience data are available, due to data limitations.](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/19ZBIhzTrNlumV9ZhCmsdEcvybFHp-eN5P5IFAsFmql0/pub?w=558&h=721)

Pressures and resilience are ultimately important for scores, but they have a smaller contribution to the overall scores because we can only approximate their effects. Individual pressures are ranked for their importance to different goals based on published studies and expert opinion. Resilience actions are the best way to improve a score, because they can reduce pressures, protect ocean habitats and species, improve status, and optimize benefits to people.

 Pressures and resilience are usually summarized across ecological and social pressure categories in order to reveal the influence of any one factor that might be present. The this way, for example, pressures from pollution, habitat destruction, fishing pressure, species pollution, and climate change will have a cumulative impact on the scores.

## **Food Provision**

> The aim of **Food Provision** is to optimize the sustainable level of seafood harvest in your region's waters.

The aim of this goal is to maximize the sustainable harvest of seafood in regional waters from **Wild-Caught Fisheries** and **Mariculture**, or ocean-farmed seafood. Regions are rewarded for maximizing the amount of sustainable seafood provided and they are penalized for unsustainable practices or for under-harvest. Because fisheries and mariculture are separate industries with very different features, each is tracked separately as a unique sub-goal under **Food Provision**. They are then combined after each sub-goal is weighted by the proportion of the total yield it contributes to total food provision.

### **Wild-Caught Fisheries**

>The **Wild-Caught Fisheries** sub-goal describes the amount of wild-caught seafood harvested and its sustainability for human consumption. Higher scores reflect fishing practices with sustainably high yields that avoid excessively high exploitation and do not target threatened existing fish populations.

#### Philosophy

This sub-goal measures the ability to obtain maximal wild harvests without damaging the ocean's ability to continue providing similar quantities of fish for people in the future. The optimal levels are described by Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). Higher scores reflect fishing practices with sustainably high yields that avoid excessively high exploitation, or overfishing, and do not target threatened populations. Regions are penalized for resources that are either underfished or overfished because both of these conditions detract from the overall achievement of maximized food provision.

Wild-caught fisheries harvests must remain below levels that would compromise the resource and its future harvest, but the amount of seafood harvested should be maximized within the bounds of sustainability. The reference point is set with a functional relationship. This calculation model aims to assess the amount of wild-caught seafood that can be sustainably harvested, with sustainability defined by multi-species yield, and with penalties assigned for both over- and under-harvesting. This is a departure from traditional conservation goals regarding wild-caught fisheries where under-harvesting is usually not penalized. In other circumstances, penalties are only given for over-harvesting, such as in the case for concerned fisheries managers who use over-harvesting as a way to guide enforcement. In the case of OHI, however, the idea is to assess the delivery of a sustainable benefit or the missed opportunity for one, and therefore any distance from the optimum is a penalty.

This sub-goal can interact with other goals and sub-goals through, for example through the destruction of surrounding habitats that can  decrease the productivity of farmed fisheries indirectly.

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally, data for catch size and amount of effort of every commercially- and recreationally-fished species would be available for a place, as well as the functional relationship between the fish population's size in terms of biomass, and fisheries catch effort. This would allow an accurate MSY to be calculated appropriate for the region. Then, fisheries catch and effort information would be used to calculate the present state and MSY would be used to set the reference point. Current status would be calculated using the present state of every species in turn and then combining each species together to get a weighted proportion of the total catch.

#### Keep in Mind

The assessment sustainability, of course, depends on the quality of the underlying stock assessments. Better methods for data-poor stocks had been developed in Global 2013, improving upon those developed for Global 2012. When better data are available and local experts have produced formal stock assessments, better-informed models can be developed, as was done in U.S. West Coast study (2014).

This sub-goal also cannot determine whether the set-points are optimum for other parts of system. For example, this model does not address food security more broadly because this goal does not assess where or by whom the catch is being consumed, and it does not assess nutrition quality either. Potentially, the outcome from assessing the **Food Provision** goal could be used as input if a separate 'food security assessment' were developed.

***

### **Mariculture**

>**Mariculture** measures the ability to reach the highest levels of seafood gained from far-raised facilities without damaging the ocean's ability to provide fish sustainably now and in the future.

#### Philosophy

Mariculture practices must be sustainable and also maximize the amount of food production that is physically possible and desired by regional governments and those who buy, sell and eat that food. This sub-goal shows whether or not maximal seafood yield from farm-raised facilities is occurring without damaging the ocean’s ability to continue providing fish for people in the future. It is founded on the idea that mariculture practices must not inhibit the future production of seafood in the area.

Higher scores mean that food provisioning is being done in a sustainable manner while not compromising the water quality in the farmed area and not relying on wild populations to feed or replenish the cultivated species. A score of 100 means that a region is sustainably harvesting the greatest amount of farmed seafood possible based on its own maximum potential relative to the conditions of the assessment. As for **Wild-Caught Fisheries**, a low score can indicate one of two things – that species are either being farmed in an unsustainable manner, or that assessed areas are not maximizing the potential to farm in their waters.

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally, information on the spatial area available for mariculture would be available, as well as data on the sustainability of that production. Availability could be determined by social expectations and priorities, not just geographical space. This would mean that data are available for the physical coastal and offshore habitat appropriate for each intended type of mariculture service and that areas have been identified as socially appropriate. At a regional scale, better data should demonstrate any restrictions based on habitat, conflicting uses, and social preferences.

#### Keep in Mind

This approach would not necessarily penalize regions that have less geographic area available for mariculture, because it is relative to what is marked as available. However, places with fewer sheltered bays or lower primary production, for example, could be at a disadvantage compared to places that have more favorable conditions.

The appropriateness of the approach will also vary depending on the geography and what's socially desirable. For instance, in the Global 2012 study, China's ratio of area dedicated to mariculture production relative to area available showed the highest score and therefore became the reference point against which other countries' values were compared. Simply maximizing isn't always desirable, however. The social component is important because mariculture competes for space with many other ocean uses, including other kinds of fishing and tourism activities. This sub-goal reveals linkages among ocean health issues.

>As another example, Global 2012 did not have information about social limitations for how much coastal area could be allotted to mariculture, and therefore it included the entire area of the coastline in the calculation. This assumed that mariculture could be developed everywhere, which isn't always socially desirable.

## **Artisanal Fishing Opportunities**

> The **Artisanal Fishing Opportunties** goal shows whether people with the desire to fish on small scales have the opportunity to do so.

#### Philosophy

It is important to capture the degree to which a region permits or encourages artisanal fishing compared to the demand for such fishing opportunities, and if possible, the sustainability of artisanal fishing practices.

The artisanal fishing opportunities goal measures the opportunities for artisanal fishing rather than the amount of fish caught (covered in the **Food Provision** goal) or the household revenue earned from the activities (covered in the **Livelihoods and Economies** goal). In the Global Assessments, higher scores reflect high potential for the local population to access local ocean resources, regardless of whether or not those people actually do get access. This goal is about economic access,  physical access, and access to the fish themselves. Economic access is comprised of needs and costs involved, and physical access is determined by how possible it is for individuals to get to the resource. Access to the fish themselves is a reflection of how robust fish populations are measured ot be.

Damaging practices are sometimes used in artisanal fishing, such as the use of cyanide or dynamite, and these are penalized in the Index calculations. Such practices also lead **Artisanal Fishing Opportunities** to interact in a negative way with other goals.

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally, this goal would include some measure of how easy or hard it is for people to access ocean resources when they need them and a quantified evaluation of the sustainability of harvest of all nearshore stocks used by artisanal fishermen. It will require the creative combination of different kind of data elements.

#### Keep in Mind

This goal reflects only the access people have to coastal resources, not necessarily whether they actually do fish in those waters. In other words, It measures the potential for artisanal fishing whether or not this potential is actually met. This is because this goal specifically tries to estimate whether individuals or households have the access to the sea that they need for their own survival. The status for this goal is estimated as a function of need for artisanal fishing opportunities and whether or not the opportunity is permitted or encouraged institutionally, and whether artisanal fishing could be sustainable.

Keep in mind also that the amount of seafood caught, if reported, is contained within the **Food Provision** or **Natural Products** goals. Meanwhile, any wages or revenue are included instead in the **Livelihoods and Economies** goal. The data for this goal should therefore reflect its unique intention.

***

## **Natural Products**

> The **Natural Products** goal describes how sustainably people harvest non-food products from the sea.

#### Philosophy

**Natural Products** evaluates the levels of sustainability for all ocean-derived goods that are traded. These include shells, sponges, corals, seaweeds, fish oil, and ornamental fishes, among other things. It does not included products that are consumed for only nutrition, but may in some cases include products that are consumed as medicine. In the Global Assessments, the goal model calculates overall status by weighting the status of sustainable harvest of each extracted marine product by its proportional value relative to other harvested products. Higher scores reflect sustainable extraction of non-food ocean resources with little to no impact on surrounding habitats, marine species, or human well-being.

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally, quantity, value, and a sustainability rating of the harvest method would be available for every marine and coastally-derived natural product within the regions of a study area. This would include a wide range of products, including corals, shells, seaweeds, aquarium fish, mangrove wood, or any non-food marine product that is harvested within a region. The ideal reference point would be derived from a functional relationship of the sustainability of the harvest for each product relative to the amount of product available in the ecosystem, informed by scientific studies.

#### Keep in Mind

This goal does not include non-living items such as oil, gas, and mining products, because these practices are not considered to be sustainable. They are also done at such relatively large scales that including them would essentially make an index for those sectors specifically. This goal also does not include any valuation of things like bioprospecting for medicines through genetic discoveries, which  has an unpredictable potential value occurring in the future rather than measurable value now.

 The activities that drive this goal can interact with other goals and sub-goals when unsustainable harvesting practices are used. Because so little is known about some of the functions relationships between the amount of natural products taken and the effect of harvest on their quantities in the ecosystem, assumptions often have to be made to set the reference points in the calculations.

## **Carbon Storage**

> **Carbon Storage** describes how much carbon is stored in natural coastal ecosystems that absorb and sequester it in large amounts.

#### Philosophy

**Carbon Storage** evaluates the status of coastal marine habitats with high carbon storage capacity. In this case, "storage" means carbon sequestration. Highly productive coastal wetland ecosystems, like mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass beds, have substantially larger areal carbon burial rates than terrestrial forests. Coastal habitats therefore play a significant role in mitigating global carbon levels, and the health of these habitats is important because their destruction also releases large quantities of carbon into the atmosphere, damaging the overall health of coupled marine systems and furthering global climate change.

> Though they form less than 2% of the ocean’s surface, coastal ecosystems contribute more to long-term carbon storage and sequestration in sediments than any other ocean ecosystem.

 Our focus here is on coastal habitats, so-called "Blue Carbon", because they have large potential to store carbon without causing acidification, and, contrary to open oceans, they provide a carbon storage service that can be affected by human actions such as conservation, and restoration efforts.

> The Global 2012 assessment focuses on three ecosystems — mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses — for their ability to store and sequester carbon in their plants and soils. When destroyed or degraded, these ecosystems not only stop sequestering carbon but can start to release it, and can emit carbon for centuries and contribute to climate change.

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally, to assess the amount of carbon stored in every coastal habitat, information would be available regarding coverage area and some measure of quality. For example, you would have data for both the spatial coverage of a mangrove and know its tree density. Additionally, different weights would be assigned to the habitats based on their relative ability to store carbon. The carbon storage model can incorporate such weights once they are available in a similar way to the methods developed for the coastal protection goal. The reference point for habitat-based goals will likely be a comparison with a historic extent or state; this means that historic data are needed such that current habitat extent data can be compared to them.

> TIP: The relative carbon storage abilities for different habitats is an area of active research.

#### Keep in Mind

Even though the pelagic oceanic plays a large role in the sequestration of anthropogenic carbon, by acting as a large carbon sink, the mechanisms for open ocean carbon storage cannot be managed locally or regionally as there are no practical methods for intervention or manipulation. On top of that, the storage of global carbon in ocean water leads to its acidification, which has many consequences for marine life.

Because they store carbon for less than one hundred years, seaweeds and corals were not included in the **Carbon Storage** goal in the Global Assessments. While the pelagic oceanic carbon sink, consisting of phytoplankton, plays a large role in the sequestration of anthropogenic carbon, the pelagic ocean mechanisms are not amenable to local or regional management intervention. Phytoplankton contribute to carbon fixation when they die and sink to the sea bottom at sufficient depth, because it is effectively out of circulation. However, if those phytoplankton are eaten, the carbon is cycled back into the system and not sequestered.

Something that could potentially be included in the **Carbon Storage** goal in the future is mollusc shells, if they are added to a landfill and not recycled in the sea. So if information on mariculture production and waste disposal are available, this could be an interesting addition to carbon storage at a regional scale.

***

## **Coastal Protection**

> **Coastal Protection** describes the condition and extent of habitats that protect the coasts against storm waves and flooding. It measures the area they currently cover relative to the area they covered in the recent past.

#### Philosophy

Many habitats, including coral reefs, mangroves, seagrasses, salt marshes, and sea ice, act as natural buffers against storm damage and erosion. By protecting against incoming waves, flooding, and and other erosive factors, these living habitats keep people safe and can help mitigate economic loss of personal and public property, cultural landmarks, and natural resources. The **Coastal Protection** goal assesses the amount of protection provided by marine and coastal habitats by measuring the area they cover now relative to the area they covered in the recent past.

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally, data for all habitats within regions of a study area would be available, as well as information on the value of the land and the vulnerability of inhabitants being protected by these habitats. This would require data for each habitat type at a high spatial resolution as well as a measure of the value of what is protected by the habitats. The reference point for habitat-based goals will likely be a temporal baseline and historic data would be needed such that current habitat and value data can be compared to them.

#### Keep in Mind

The Global studies did not include an assessment of the protection afforded by human-made structures such as jetties and seawalls, because these structures cannot be preserved without maintenance and do not constitute long-term sustainable services. They may also have other undesirable side effects such as the altering of sedimentation rates causing erosion in new and unexpected locations. Although this phenomenon is closely tied to human habitation, it does not account for such things as property values as indicators but rather it focuses on what the habitats actually are and the protection that they provide.

## **Coastal Livelihoods and Economies**

> The **Coastal Livelihoods and Economies** goal rewards productive coastal economies that avoid the loss of ocean-dependent livelihoods while maximizing livelihood quality.

This goal is founded on two sub-goals, **Livelihoods** and **Economies**. **Livelihoods** is comprised of jobs and wages, and **Economies** is comprised of revenues. The two halves of this goal are tracked separately because the number and quality of jobs and the amount of revenue produced are both of considerable interest to stakeholders and governments, and could show very different patterns, such as is the case when high revenue sectors do not necessarily provide large employment opportunities. The goal aims to maintain the number of coastal and ocean-dependent livelihoods (jobs) in a region, and maintain productive coastal economies (revenues), while also maximizing livelihood quality (represented by relative wages).

> This is an area where economic studies are integrated and inform the concept of ocean health.

#### Keep in Mind

Maintaining jobs in this case means not losing jobs--this sub-goal does not give credit for *gaining* jobs in the Global Assessments. It does not attempt to capture aspects of job identity like reputation, desirability, or other social or cultural perspectives associated with different jobs, nor does it account for the impact upon an individual but rather focuses on the aggregate. One can examine the component parts that make up this goal, however, to evaluate individual sectors and infer implications for job identity.

### **Livelihoods**

> The **Livelihoods** sub-goal describes livelihood quantity and quality.

#### Philosophy

This sub-goal evaluates the quantitative and qualitative benefits workers get from the oceans in the form of jobs and wages. In the Global Assessments, the two sub-components are equally important because the number of jobs is a proxy for livelihood quantity, and the per capita average annual wages is a proxy for job quality. Some relevant sectors include tourism, commercial fishing, marine mammal watching, and working at ports and harbors, among others. Jobs and wages produced from marine-related industries are clearly of huge value to many people, and directly benefit those who are employed--they also benefit those who do not directly participate in the industries but rather gain indirectly from the value of community identity, tax revenues, and other indirect economic and social impacts of a stable coastal economy.

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally, this goal would represent and encompass all marine sectors that supply jobs and wages to coastal communities, incorporating information on the sustainability of different sectors and also working conditions and job satisfaction. Job identity would also be an important part of this. Capturing the indirect as well as direct benefits from jobs, wages and revenue from coastal communities and beyond is best; where data do not exist, multipliers derived from the literature can be incorporated into jobs to attempt to capture this. The reference point in this sub-goal will likely be set as a moving window temporal approach, or a spatial comparison.

#### Keep in Mind

It's important to note that the data approaches taken to date in the Global Assessments are imperfect, and do not represent the one way to convey the importance of individual identity with coastal work. The values are shown for the aggregate community and are proxies for quality-of-life of the individual. In further assessments, any new data that may otherwise speak to well-being would represent a useful improvement. 

*****

### **Economies**

> The **Economies** sub-goal captures the economic value associated with marine industries using revenue from marine sectors.

#### Philosophy

The **Economies** sub-goal evaluates the revenue generated from marine-based industries. Strong coastal economies are something that people value, and this can be reflected by the GDP generated by these coastal regions both directly and indirectly. The economies sub-goal is composed of a single component, revenue.

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally, economic data would be collected for each coast, and traced from sectors both directly and indirectly related to marine industries. When these data are not available it is possible to use revenue data at a larger scale and adapt them to a coastal area based on population distribution. The reference point in this sub-goal will likely be set as a moving-window temporal approach.

#### Keep in Mind

The definition of a marine-related sector can vary. There are jobs that are directly connected to the marine environment, such as shipping, fishing, longshore workers, but also some that are connected indirectly, such as supplies and supporting industries. The use of multipliers in attempts to capture the indirect revenue generated by jobs more indirectly associated to marine sectors is a well-established method in economics, and is encouraged in this approach.

***

## **Tourism and Recreation**

> The **Tourism and Recreation** goal captures the value people have for experiencing and taking pleasure in coastal areas.

#### Philosophy

This goal measures the value people have for experiencing and taking pleasure in coastal and ocean areas. Tourism, travel, and recreation are major drivers of thriving coastal communities and they also offer a measure of how much people value ocean systems. By electing to visit a coastal area rather than an inland area, people express their preference for visiting these places over others. Ideally, tourism and recreation could continue indefinitely if it is done in a sustainable manner.

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally there would be data available specifically for employment in coastal tourism industries, however the best data available at a global scale report total number of jobs, not just coastal jobs, within the travel and tourism industries. These data include jobs that are directly connected to the tourism and travel industry, for both leisure and business. This could include accommodation services, food and beverage services, retail trade, transportation services, and cultural, sports and recreational services, and could exclude investment industries and suppliers. There would also be information on how the ocean is used for enjoyment by both local residents and tourists, thereby capturing the full value of touristic and recreational activities.

#### Keep in Mind

**Tourism and Recreation** does not include the revenue or livelihoods that are generated by tourism and recreation; that is captured in the **Livelihoods and Economies** goal.  This goal is not about the economic benefits, but instead about the value that people have for experiencing and enjoying coastal areas.

Models will vary greatly depending on data available; there are many ways to potentially measure the delivery of this goal.

> Unfortunately it was not possible to determine the proportion of jobs affiliated with strictly leisure travel in the Global 2013, for example. It was assumed all travel and tourism employment was related to tourism and recreation values. Additionally, it is true that not every tourist stays in a hotel and not everyone staying in a hotel is a tourist.

## **Sense of Place**

> The **Sense of Place** goal aims to capture the aspects of coastal and marine systems that people value as part of their cultural identity and connectedness to the marine environment.

The **Sense of Place** definition includes people living near the ocean and those who live far from it and still derive a sense of identity or value from knowing particular places or species exist. Since few groups, communities, or states have explicitly described the attributes of the coastal and ocean environments that have special cultural meaning to them, the Index assesses how well this goal is being delivered through the conditions of two sub-goals, **Iconic Species** and **Lasting Special Places**. The overall goal score is then the arithmetic mean of the two sub-goal scores.

### **Iconic Species**

> The **Iconic Species** sub-goal assesses the threat to species that are important to a region.

#### Philosophy

**Iconic Species** are defined as those that are relevant to local cultural identity. The intent of the sub-goal is to focus on those species widely perceived as iconic within a region, and iconic from a cultural or existence value. This is in contrast to an economic or extractive reason for valuing the species. Iconic species symbolize the cultural, spiritual, and aesthetic benefits that people hold for a region, often bringing intangible benefits to coastal communities and beyond.

They can be identified through activities such as fishing, hunting, or commerce; through local ethnic or religious practices; through existence value; and through locally-recognized aesthetic value. This can even include, for example, touristic attractions and iconic species as defined by their repeated representation in local art.

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally, data would be available on all species that are important to coastal communities, and then a separate assessment would judge the condition of each of the populations. It would ideally be possible to find an officially-sanctioned list, or a list from a trusted source, of the iconic species for an area.

#### Keep in Mind

The type of valuation carried out here stands in contrast to simply an economic or extractive reason for valuing the species. Even so, because almost any species can be iconic to to different groups or individuals, and defining which species are culturally iconic can be challenging. Information can sometimes be found from local customs and experts, oral tradition, sociological or anthropological literature, journalism, and regional studies.

***

### **Lasting Special Places**

> The **Lasting Special Places** sub-goal captures the conservation status of geographic locations that hold significant aesthetic, spiritual, cultural, recreational, or existence value for people.

#### Philosophy

Th **Lasting Special Places** sub-goal focuses on those geographic locations that hold particular value for aesthetic, spiritual, cultural, recreational or existence reasons. It is different from simply quantifying protected areas because it attempts to contain the value of sustainability for human interaction. Well-maintained and protected lasting special places provide intangible but significant resources that help sustain and may also generate economic opportunities and help to sustain coastal communities, but those are captured in other goals.

> In the Global Assessments, the scores for this sub-goal are calculated based upon two assumptions: that all regions have roughly the same percentage of their coastal areas (outward to 3 nm and inland to 1 km from the shore) that qualify as lasting special places, and that the regions with the most protected areas are the closest to achieving their region-specific target.

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally, a list of all the places that people within a region consider special could be found or developed, along with an assessment of what percent of and how well those areas are protected. First-hand information could be gathered through surveys or some similar approach.

#### Keep in Mind

This goal is hard to define in terms of data. Other goals capture the economic benefits derived from **Lasting Special Places**, as well as biodiversity. This goal assesses the human-use and assumes sustainability through aesthetic, cultural, and other kinds of engagement.

***

## **Clean Waters**

> The **Clean Waters** goal captures the degree to which local waters are unpolluted by natural and human-made causes.

#### Philosophy

**Clean Waters** are important to both people and the marine life on which they depend. People enjoy having unpolluted estuarine, coastal, and marine waters both for their aesthetic value and for their importance to health. Sewage pollution, nutrient runoff, chemical pollution, and marine trash all make coastal waters less clean. This leads to human problems, such as fecal coliform ingestion, and ecosystem problems like eutrophication and algal blooms. This goal scores highest when the contamination level is zero, and the Global  model ensures that just one of the pollutants can drive the score because. The philosophy is that one of the pollutant can greatly impact the system because of the sensitivity of the system.

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally, data would be available and combined from many different categories of marine pollution to best capture the factors that can cause waters to become unsuitable for recreation or other purposes. There would be data available across various classes of contaminants, including organic pollutants, inorganic pollutants, metals, oils, turbidity, and trash. Having good data from each of the desired categories, such as those culled from a repeated effort at monitoring the conditions of the coasts, would be ideal. For the reference point, a functional relationship would be best for setting hard use limits.

#### Keep in Mind

Due to data constraints, the models described in the Global Assessments mostly used information on pollutant inputs from point sources. If in-situ measurements of water and biological uptake from organisms are available, these types of information would be preferred. Particularly, information on eutrophication anomalies, anoxic regions, and toxic blooms, would be preferable to the nutrient inputs used in previous assessment, which are really just proxies for the better data.

> In the Global Assessments, it was not possible to assess specific toxic chemicals at the global scale; however regional case studies often might have data available for the quantities and toxicity of a range of chemicals put into watersheds and coastal waters. In addition, where possible and relevant, we recommend including additional component that could not be covered in the models presented in the Global due to data constraints, such as altered sedimentation or turbidity.

## **Biodiversity**

> The **Biodiversity** goal captures the conservation status of marine species.

**Biodiversity** measures the condition of species and key habitats that support species richness and diversity. It is is measured through two sub-goals: **Species** and **Habitats**. Species were assessed because they are what one typically thinks of in relation to biodiversity, and people value biodiversity in particular for its existence value. But because only a small proportion of marine species worldwide have been mapped and scientifically assessed, habitats are used a proxy for the condition of the broad number of species that depend on them. A simple average of these two sub-goal scores produces the **Biodiversity** goal score in the Global Assessment.

### **Species**

> The **Species** sub-goal aims to estimate how successfully the richness and variety of marine life is being maintained.

#### Philosophy

The **Species** sub-goal aims to estimate how successfully the richness and variety of marine life is being maintained. People value the species that comprise marine biodiversity for their existence value as well as their contributions to resilient ecosystem structure and function. The risk of species extinction generates great emotional and moral concern for many as well.

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally, data would be available on the number of species in each region of a study area, along with their habitat ranges, and assessments of their population size or conservation status. The conservations status should be undertaken by a trusted authority, such as the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

> China, for example, has its own equivalent to the IUCN **Red List** of Endangered Species. If a country has conducted its own species surveys and assigned categories of risk, that information may be more useful than the global data not specialized to the local context.

#### Keep in Mind

The **Species** sub-goal is conceptually equal to iconic species, but it includes all species that are scientifically assessed. This will limit your data to those species that have this kind of information. The species data  layers in the Global Assessments included the amount of area where each species is present, so that species that inhabit a greater area have a greater weight in the calculations than those with a smaller range. This was different from the **Iconic Species** approach.

Note that **Biodiversity** can also play a supporting role in **Food Provision** and sustainability generally, and is therefore also included in the resilience dimensions of other public goals.

***

### **Habitats**

> The **Habitats** sub-goal measures the condition of habitats that are important for supporting a wide array of species diversity.

#### Philosophy

This sub-goal measures some of the habitats that are particularly important in supporting large numbers of marine species. Habitats are areas where animals can thrive and bring further positive benefits--whether for existence value or for other enjoyment. The amount of area needed to ensure biodiversity varies with habitat type and animal size, so therefore this is an indirect approach to representing the status of biodiversity.

> TIP: It would be possible to remove this sub-goal, in fact, if perfect data on assessed species were available, because this sub-goal is a proxy for the other half of the **Biodiversity** goal.

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally, information on the extent and condition of every single habitat type would be available through time. The reference point for habitat-based goals will likely be temporal, meaning means that historic data are needed such that current habitat and value data can be compared to historic data.

#### Keep in Mind

This sub-goal is methodologically similar to the **Carbon Storage** goal but it includes all habitats with sufficient data for this goal, not just those habitats that sequester carbon. It's also a

> TIP: Consider approaching this goal with **Carbon Storage** and other spatially explicitly goals, when conducting your assessment in Phase Three.
