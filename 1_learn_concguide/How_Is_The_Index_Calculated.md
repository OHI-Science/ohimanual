## How is the Index calculated?

For each goal, the **current status** is a mathematical model developed to best capture the philosophy of that goal relative to a target using the best available data at the scale of study. The **current status** is calculated individually for each goal and represents half of a goal’s total score.  The other half is the **likely future status**, which is based on three things:

* **Trend**: the average rate of change for status during the most recent five years

* **Pressures**: social and ecological elements that negatively affect the status of a goal

* **Resilience**: social and ecological elements (or actions) that can and reduce pressures, and maintain or raise future benefits (e.g. treaties, laws, enforcement, habitat protection)

The **current status** (50% of total score) of each goal is determined by comparing the most recent measure of the goal against a goal-specific sustainable **Reference Point**.

The **trend** (33% of total score) is calculated as the slope of the change in status based on recent data. As such, the trend calculation is not trying to predict (or model) the future, but only indicates the likely condition (sustainability) based on a linear relationship.

**Pressures and resilience** (17% -- 8.5% each of total score) are important for scores, although they have a smaller contribution to the overall scores because we can only approximate their effects. Individual pressures are ranked (weighted) according to their importance to different goals based on scientific literature and expert opinion. From a management intervention perspective, resilience actions are the best way to improve a score, because they can reduce pressures, protect ocean habitats and species, improve status, and optimize benefits to people.

Status, trend, likely future status, pressures, and resilience are called ‘dimensions’ within the Ocean Health Index framework.

**In the figure below**, likely future state (in yellow) is the result of the current status modified by trend, minus the negative effect of pressures (grey), plus the positive effect of resilience (salmon pink).
