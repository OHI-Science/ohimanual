# The OHI Framework and Toolbox

> The Ocean Health Index (OHI) is the first assessment framework that provides a common platform for scientifically combining and comparing all key elements from all dimensions of the ocean (ecological, social, economic, and physical) to measure how sustainably people are using ocean and coastal resources. In the OHI framework **a healthy ocean is one that sustainably delivers a range of benefits to people now and in the future.**

The OHI framework assesses ocean health by measuring a suite of key social, economic, and environmental benefits a healthy oceans provides, called "goals". By analyzing these goals together and scoring them from 0-100, OHI assessments result in a comprehensive picture of the state of the ecosystem and can be communicated to a wide range of audiences. 

The Ocean Health Index is not an index of ecosystem services. In creating an inventory of all elements that are considered part of a healthy ocean under a wider definition, various categories began to evolve. The ten goals (and eight sub-goals) that make up the Index broadly capture the universal ocean benefits that people value:

- [**Food Provision**](FP_Philosophy) from sustainably harvested or cultured fish stocks
- [**Artisanal Fishing Opportunities**](AO_Philosophy) for local communities to engage in sustainable practices
- [**Natural Products**](NP_Philosophy) that are sustainably extracted from the ocean
- [**Carbon Storage**](CS_Philosophy) in coastal habitats
- [**Coastal Protection**](CP_Philosophy) from inundation and erosion
- [**Sense of Place**](SP_Philosophy) from culturally valued iconic species, habitats, and landscapes
- [**Livelihoods and Economies**](LE_Philosophy) from coastal and ocean-dependent communities
- [**Tourism and Recreation**](TR_Philosophy) opportunities
- [**Clean Waters**](CW_Philosophy) and beaches for aesthetic and health values
- [**Biodiversity**](BIO_Philosophy) of species and habitats

## OHI Workflow

The conceptual framework and technical toolbox both consists of two major parts: core and tailored. The "core" maintains the integrity and definition of Ocean Health, while the "tailored" allows flexibility of local adaptation of OHI framework. OHI+ assessments are responsible for modifying the "tailored" part of the framework and toolbox, thereby truely accommodating different scales, data availabilities, and cultural priorities. A large part of "tailoring" involves choosing and modifying goal models. While the 10 goals identified in the Index represent broadly-held public benefits globally, they might not apply to your local territories. We provide detailed instructions on how to choose and change your own goals in the [Conduct phase](/manual/).

<--! The Index did not set out to have ten goals. As you may have already noticed, OHI moves away from the concepts of ocean health that only consider ecological attributes by including social, cultural, and economic dimensions. The process of reviewing literature (particularly policy documents) revealed that for many cultures ocean health often involves human dimensions: healthy communities, thriving economies, preservation of cultural habits, etc. In creating an inventory of all elements that are considered part of a healthy ocean under this wider definition, various categories began to evolve. Many components were folded into these categories (notaly ecological and social pressures and resilience measures), which when combined with the process of assessing management targets for healthy oceans, resulted in the ten goals (and eight sub-goals) that make up the Index. Regions where some goals are not relevant can (and should) be assessed based only on the remaining goals. The Index is flexible to the inclusion of different or additional goals, something we have not yet encountered but is certainly possible. 

### Changing Goal Models <!---I feel this might be premature here--->

In this site we provide guidelines on how to adapt goal models to available regional data, using simpler models or different proxies when necessary. However, we cannot prescribe which available regional data sets are preferred, what goal models are more appropriate, or which reference points, proxy data, and goal weights should be used. Making these decisions effectively requires involving local experts of the study area to provide opinions and direction towards an outcome most representative of ocean health in the study area. Our team can help guide you and offer technical support as you make these decisions.

The Index can also accommodate additional goals if they better reflect what local communities value, although we feel that the ten goals currently defined within the Index are sufficiently broad to capture a vast majority of values. No indicator is exempt from such subjective decisions. The Indexâ€™s framework, however, requires to document and track such assumptions explicitly and thus, contrary to many other existing indices, allows for careful assessment of the sensitivity of results to such decisions. -->
