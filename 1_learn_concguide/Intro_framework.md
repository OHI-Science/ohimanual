**Welcome to the Ocean Health Index (OHI)!** OHI is the first assessment framework that combines and compares all dimensions of the ocean - ecological, social, economic, and physical - to measure how sustainably people are using ocean and coastal resources.

You are currenlty at the first of four phases of conducting an OHI assessment - the **Learn** Phase. Here you will get an overview of the OHI framework, its workflow, what to expect from an OHI assessment, and how the scores are calculated, in order to prepare yourself for the next planning phase of an assessment. You will also be introduced to the philosophy behind each OHI goal.

For a more in-depth look at OHI and its process, check out our other web materials, including [Presentations](http://ohi-science.org/new-site/resources/downloads/), and [Publications](http://ohi-science.org/resources/publications/). If you want to know more about how to define and measure each goal, visit the [Goals](http://ohi-science.org/goals/) page.

Let's get started!

# Introduction

The OHI framework assesses a suite of key **social, economic, and ecological** benefits a healthy oceans provides, called "goals". By analyzing these goals together and scoring them from 0-100, OHI assessments result in a comprehensive picture of the state of the ecosystem and can be communicated to a wide range of audiences.

In the OHI framework **a healthy ocean is one that sustainably delivers a range of benefits to people now and in the future.** The Ocean Health Index is not an index of ecosystem services. In creating an inventory of all elements that are considered part of a healthy ocean under a wider definition, various categories began to evolve. The ten goals (and eight sub-goals) that are commonly included in an Index broadly capture the universal ocean benefits:

- [**Food Provision**](http://ohi-science.org/learn/#food-provision) from sustainably harvested or cultured fish stocks
- [**Artisanal Fishing Opportunities**](http://ohi-science.org/new-site/learn/#artisanal-fishing-opportunities) for local communities to engage in sustainable practices
- [**Natural Products**](http://ohi-science.org/learn/#natural-products) that are sustainably extracted from the ocean
- [**Carbon Storage**](http://ohi-science.org/learn/#carbon-storage) in coastal habitats
- [**Coastal Protection**](http://ohi-science.org/learn/#coastal-protection) from inundation and erosion
- [**Sense of Place**](http://ohi-science.org/learn/#sense-of-place) from culturally valued iconic species, habitats, and landscapes
- [**Livelihoods and Economies**](http://ohi-science.org/learn/#coastal-livelihoods-and-economies) from coastal and ocean-dependent communities
- [**Tourism and Recreation**](http://ohi-science.org/learn/#tourism-and-recreation) opportunities
- [**Clean Waters**](http://ohi-science.org/learn/#clean-waters) and beaches for aesthetic and health values
- [**Biodiversity**](http://ohi-science.org/learn/#biodiversity) of species and habitats

This framework was first applied to the global scale in 2012, and since then, numerous independent groups have adopted the framework to assess ocean health in their own countries or regions. Although conducted at different spatial and temporal scales, all OHI assessments follow the same workflow.

## Four Phases of OHI+

There are [four phases of OHI+ assessment](http://ohi-science.org/new-site/phases/): **Learn**, **Plan**, **Conduct**, and **Inform**. You are currently in the _Learn_ Phase, where you will understand OHI framework and philosophy, and determine the needs and purposes of your OHI+ assessment.

## OHI Workflow

You will first build a conceptual framework and determine which goals to access and how, which is then translated into the toolbox to calculate the scores. Both the conceptual framework and technical toolbox consist of two major parts: **core** and **tailored**. The "core" maintains the integrity of Ocean Health and determines how Index scores are calculated, while the "tailored" allows flexibility and accommodates different scales, data availabilities, and cultural priorities.

OHI+ teams are responsible for modifying the "tailored" part of the framework and toolbox, thereby truly ensuring local adaptation. Besides incorporating local data, a large part of _tailoring_ involves choosing and modifying goal models. While the 10 goals identified in the Index represent broadly-held public benefits globally, they might not apply to your local territories. We provide detailed instructions on how to choose and change your own goals in the [Conduct phase](/manual/).

## Outcomes of an OHI+ assessment

Your completed assessment will produce OHI scores for each goal in every region of your study area, and scores within the assessment can be compared with one another. Goal scores range between 0 and 100, and are visualized in a _Flower Plot_ for easy communication with a wide audience - each pedal represents one goal, and the size of the pedal corresponds with its score.

However, these scores will not be quantitatively comparable to those of other OHI assessments because they differ in the underlying inputs, goal models, and reference points.

## What support we provide

Our team of scientists and managers is prepared to provide guidance for regional assessments, from initial meetings to the technical calculations to disseminating results. We have created a suite of **guides and manuals** that provide in-depth information for the Ocean Health Index+ assessment process in addition to recommendations on how to best approach the task, including:

* A Guide to [Planning OHI+ Assessments](http://ohi-science.org/plan/) and [Informing Decision-Making](http://ohi-science.org/inform/)

* The Ocean Health Index [Toolbox Manual](/manual/)

In addition, you will have access to the OHI+ online community via our [Forum](/forum/)
