**How are the goals weighted?**The goals are currently (and by default in the OHI Toolbox) weighted equally. However, weighting can be changed depending on your local values, if information on these values is available. Stakeholders may have differing priorities, but when presented with the portfolio of goals used in the Ocean Health Index, these differences can become less pronounced, as was found in a recent study by Halpern *et al.* (2013) in *Marine Policy*.
