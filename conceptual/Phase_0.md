# Phase 0 - Introduction

## **What is the Ocean Health Index?**

> The Index is the first assessment framework that provides a common platform for scientifically combining and comparing key elements from all dimensions of the ocean to measure how sustainably people are using the oceans.

The Ocean Health Index (OHI) measures how sustainably the world is interacting with its oceans. It offers the necessary metrics to find the right balance of priorities to ensure that oceans can continue to sustainably deliver their diverse range of benefits and services to people now and in the future. The framework itself is structured around clearly defined **goals** coupled with findings of how the **likely future state** is affected by the social and ecological **pressures** and **resilience** that influence ocean health. The scores are calculated using the best available science, data, and indicators that can be applied to the geographic scale. Scores reflect how well coastal regions are using their ocean benefits in a sustainable way, where a score of 100 means that the evaluated system achieved its defined target, and a score of 0 mean no benefits were achieved or they were achieved in an unsustainable manner.

As a composite index, the Ocean Health Index integrates the results across disciplines and sectors and expresses them through broadly-held public goals:

- [**Food Provision**](FP_Philosophy) from sustainably harvested or cultured fish stocks
- [**Artisanal Fishing Opportunities**](AO_Philosophy) for local communities to engage in sustainable practices
- [**Natural Products**](NP_Philosophy) that are sustainably extracted from the ocean
- [**Carbon Storage**](CS_Philosophy) in coastal habitats
- [**Coastal Protection**](CP_Philosophy) from inundation and erosion
- [**Sense of Place**](SP_Philosophy) from culturally valued iconic species, habitats, and landscapes
- [**Livelihoods and Economies**](LE_Philosophy) from coastal and ocean-dependent communities
- [**Tourism and Recreation**](TR_Philosophy) opportunities
- [**Clean Waters**](CW_Philosophy) and beaches for aesthetic and health values
- [**Biodiversity**](BIO_Philosophy) of species and habitats

## The Benefit of OHI+

The Index is a highly tailorable approach ready to meet the needs and priorities of those who wish to use the ocean sustainably. The OHI framework is repeatable, transparent, quantitative, and goal-driven, and because of this it now being expressed through independent Ocean Health Index+ (OHI+) assessments. The inputs to the OH+ assessments use the same overarching framework while consisting of data and indicators specifically relevant to the local context. Such a flexible framework allows OHI+ assessments to adapt to local conditions while still being comparable within its scope and across time.

> Outside partners are now using the Index framework to conduct their own independent assessments, called Ocean Health Index+ (OHI+) assessments. OHI+ assessments are local interpretations of the original Global Assessments conducted for the first time in 2012 (Halpern *et al.* 2012). The methods have improved since then, and researchers have changed the goals, models, and data in their assessments in an ever-evolving process that characterizes the Index.

The Index is the first assessment tool that provides a common platform for scientifically combining and comparing key elements from all dimensions of the oceans health — biological, physical, economic, and social – to measure how sustainably people are using the ocean. By allowing for a comprehensive and integrated view of marine systems as a way to understand the trade-offs and synergies among these goals, the Index represents a significant advance over conventional single-sector approaches to assessing sustainability as communicated through other kinds of index efforts.

The OHI supports the growing need for marine management to establish comprehensive objectives that maximize the ocean-derived benefits delivered to people while at the same time keeping oceans healthy. As a management tool, the Index can inform decision-making by helping stakeholders identify geographic and thematic priorities for management, which increases the cost-effectiveness of actions taken. At the same time, it addresses the desire for policymakers to increase environmental performance in the face of budget constraints for natural resource conservation, and galvanizes efforts towards ecosystem-based management.

## The Process of OHI+

> TIP: The amount of time required to do an OHI+ Assessment will vary.

The OHI+ process consists of four distinct phases. In the first phase, you will learn about the OHI and understand the philosophy behind it and the motivation for conducting your study. In the second phase, you will actively plan to conduct an OHI+ Assessment. In the third phase, you will engage with the science of finding the data, preparing the goal models, and taking the necessary steps to learn the software and produce the results. In the final phase, you will communicate the results of your OHI+ Assessment in order to inform stakeholders who will use its findings.

- **Phase 1:** **Learn** about the OHI
- **Phase 2:** **Plan** an OHI+ Assessment
- **Phase 3:** **Conduct** the OH+ Assessment
- **Phase 4:** **Communicate** and Inform

When conducting an assessment, is it useful to use our timeline as a guide, knowing that the amount of time required to do an assessment will vary. It is important to keep in mind that the process of conducting the assessment requires collaboration and iteration among your team to arrive at the best results possible. The process of conducting an assessment is a scientific one and good documentation to track the decision-making along the way will support the validity of the results.
