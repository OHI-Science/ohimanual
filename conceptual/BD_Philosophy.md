###**Biodiversity**

This goal captures the conservation status of marine species. Because the status of only a small portion of the world's species has been assessed, the condition of habitats is also calculated as proxy for the status of the many species that rely upon them. Thus, the condition of species and key habitats that support species richness and diversity is measured through two sub-goals: habitats and species. A simple average of these two sub-goal scores was used to obtain a single biodiversity goal score.

  - ####**Species**

    This sub-goal is conceptually equal to iconic species, but it includes all species that are assessed. The second difference is it also includes the amount of area where each species is present. So species that inhabit a greater area have a greater weight in the calculations than those with a smaller range.

    This sub-goal aims to estimate how successfully the richness and variety of marine life is being maintained. People value the species that comprise marine biodiversity for their existence value as well as their contributions to resilient ecosystem structure and function. Biodiversity can also play a supporting role in food provision and sustainability generally, and is therefore also included in resilience dimensions of other public goals.

    Ideally, data would be available on the number of species in each region of a study area, their habitat ranges, and assessments of their population or conservation status. The type of reference point used will depend on the data available.

  - ####**Habitats**

    This sub-goal measures the condition of habitats that are important for supporting a wide array of species diversity.

    Because not all species have been assessed, this sub-goal measures some of the habitats that are particularly important in supporting large numbers of marine species. This sub-goal is conceptually similar to the carbon storage goal but includes all habitats with sufficient data, not just those that sequester carbon.

    Ideally, information on the extent and condition of every single habitat type would be available. The reference point for habitat-based goals will likely be temporal; this means that historic data are needed such that current habitat and value data can be compared to historic data.
