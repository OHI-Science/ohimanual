##**Biodiversity**

> The **Biodiversity** goal captures the conservation status of marine species.

Because the status of only a small portion of the world's species has been assessed, the condition of habitats is also calculated as proxy for the status of the many species that rely upon them. Thus, the condition of species and key habitats that support species richness and diversity is measured through two sub-goals: habitats and species. A simple average of these two sub-goal scores was used to obtain a single biodiversity goal score.

People value biodiversity in particular for its existence value. The risk of species extinction generates great emotional and moral concern for many people. As such, this goal assesses the conservation status of species based on the best available global data through two sub-goals: Species and Habitats. Species were assessed because they are what one typically thinks of in relation to biodiversity. Because only a small proportion of marine species worldwide have been mapped and assessed, we also assessed Habitats as part of this goal, and considered them a proxy for condition of the broad suite of species that depend on them.

###**Species**

> The **Species** sub-goal aims to estimate how successfully the richness and variety of marine life is being maintained.

#### Philosophy

This sub-goal aims to estimate how successfully the richness and variety of marine life is being maintained. People value the species that comprise marine biodiversity for their existence value as well as their contributions to resilient ecosystem structure and function. Biodiversity can also play a supporting role in food provision and sustainability generally, and is therefore also included in resilience dimensions of other public goals.

#### Keep in Mind

It is conceptually equal to iconic species, but it includes all species that are assessed. The second difference is it also includes the amount of area where each species is present. So species that inhabit a greater area have a greater weight in the calculations than those with a smaller range.

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally, data would be available on the number of species in each region of a study area, their habitat ranges, and assessments of their population or conservation status. The type of reference point used will depend on the data available.

#### History of the Approach

Assessment | Model Description and Reference Point | Evolution of Approach | Interpreting a score
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
**Global 2012** | For the Species sub-goal, we used recent assessments by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)- Global Marine Species Assessment of the extinction risk status of 2377 species for which distribution maps also exist across a wide range of taxa to provide a geographic snapshot of how total marine biodiversity is faring, even though it is a very small sub-sample of overall species diversity. The status of assessed species was calculated as the area- and threat status-weighted average of the number of threatened species within each 0.5 degree grid cell. Species distribution and threat category data came from the IUCN Global Marine Species Assessment results.<br  /><br  />The target for the species sub-goal is to have all species at a risk status of Least Concern. We scaled the lower end of the biodiversity goal to be 0 when 75% species are extinct, a level comparable to the five documented mass extinctions and that would constitute a catastrophic loss of biodiversity. | We did not include ecological integrity measures as they are based on the same data used to calculate Status and Trend. | A score of 100 would indicate that over 75% of species have a ‘least concern’ risk of extinction.
**Global 2013** | The goal model and reference point were the same as Global 2012. | Updates were available for data used for this goal.  It is important to note that extinction risk estimates for significantly more species were released in the past year, such that the scores needed to be updated for this sub-goal (and therefore the biodiversity goal overall) for 2012 to reflect improved reporting of species assessments (e.g., data quality). Actual changes in risk status from last year to this year occurred for only 15 of 6080 species, primarily because species are rarely re-assessed; in other words, only when species are reassessed can the status score of this sub-goal change. |
**Brazil (2014)** | The status of assessed species was calculated as the threat status-weighted average of all species occurring in the Brazilian EEZ (we did not weight by area of occurrence as in Global 2012 because distribution maps were not available for all species at the time of this assessment). The sub-goal was therefore calculated at the national level, giving equal weight to all species occurring in Brazilian waters. Threat weights were assigned based on the IUCN threat categories status of each species.<br  /><br  />The reference point was the same was Global 2012. | A list of marine species that occur in Brazil and were evaluated globally under the IUCN Red List assessment process was combined with a list of species assessed regionally in Brazil using the same criteria (Brazilian Red List assessments from Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation; see Data Layers). We substitute global assessments for regional (Brazil-specific) assessments whenever these were available. We had assessments for a total of 504 species. |
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | The model description and reference point were the same as Global 2012, with regional data available for threat categories. | Data were available at a regional scale, but the approach was the same as Global 2012. |

###**Habitats**

> The **Habitats** sub-goal measures the condition of habitats that are important for supporting a wide array of species diversity.

#### Philosophy

Because not all species have been assessed, this sub-goal measures some of the habitats that are particularly important in supporting large numbers of marine species. This sub-goal is conceptually similar to the carbon storage goal but includes all habitats with sufficient data, not just those that sequester carbon.

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally, information on the extent and condition of every single habitat type would be available. The reference point for habitat-based goals will likely be temporal; this means that historic data are needed such that current habitat and value data can be compared to historic data.

**Global 2012** | The status of the Habitat sub-goal was assessed for all habitats for which at least some global data were available, specifically: mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass beds, salt marshes, sea ice edge, and subtidal soft-bottom habitats. Status was assessed as the average of the condition estimates for each habitat present in a region.<br  /><br  />In the global study, the current condition of salt marshes, seagrasses, mangroves and corals was compared to a reference year that is intended to represent optimal conditions (1980 for salt marshes and sand dunes, varied by site for seagrasses). We generally considered the reference years to be between 1980-1995 and the current years to be between 2001-2010, although these varied by habitat due to data availability. | A significant amount of pre-processing of the habitat data was needed to fill data gaps and resolve data quality issues (see the data layers section for details on data sources). Because consistent habitat monitoring data were unavailable for many regions, anomalous values can occur. | A score of 100 would indicate that habitat coverage had not reduced when compared to the temporal reference point.
**Global 2013** | The goal model and reference point were the same as Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2013. |
**Brazil (2014)** | The goal model was the same as as Global 2012 for mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass beds, salt marshes, and subtidal soft-bottom habitats.<br  /><br  />The timeframes between current and reference condition vary across habitats, but we generally used a 20-year gap. However, it is important to bear in mind that we were able to obtain only a few time-series in which habitat health was resampled through time, so that information from a few point estimates had to be used to infer the health of a large and highly heterogeneous region. | The approach was the same as Global 2012. |
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | Same as Global 2012 for salt marshes, seagrasses, sand dunes, and soft-bottom habitats. Additionally, when assessing habitat condition, we used reconstructions of historic extents to set more ambitious targets.<br  /><br  />To establish our temporal reference points we instead set our reference uniquely for each habitat, as a percentage of pre-industrialized habitat coverage for salt marshes, as habitat extent between the 1950s and 1960s for sand dunes, or we utilized pressures on habitats as a proxy of habitat condition for seagrasses and soft bottom habitats. | Reliable, comprehensive habitat extent data prior to the 1990s are unavailable for most coastal regions within the U.S. Estimates of habitat loss since European settlement have been extrapolated in some regions for some habitats. However, while the habitat extent from the 1990s would represent a very un-ambitious target, a pre-industrialized reference point for habitat extent is considered an unrealistic goal under current conditions. To establish our temporal reference points we instead set our reference uniquely for each habitat, as a percentage of pre-industrialized habitat coverage for salt marshes; and as habitat extent between the 1950s and 1960s for sand dunes. We utilized pressures on habitats as a proxy of habitat condition for seagrasses and soft bottom habitats. |
