##**What is the Ocean Health Index?**

The Ocean Health Index scores important **Goals** of ocean health. The Ocean Health Index defines a healthy ocean as one that can sustainably deliver a range of benefits to people now and in the future, while not compromising the state of the oceans and coasts. A healthy ocean in this definition, however, is not necessarily a pristine ocean, although the Index allows for pristine systems as well as sustainably used systems to score highly. In fewer words, the OHI is about balance.

The scores are calculated using the best available data and indicators at the scale of the assessment. Scores reflect how well coastal regions optimize their potential ocean benefits and services in a sustainable way relative to a reference point, also known as a target, on a scale of 0 to 100. Because the Index compares scores against the available data within the scope of a given study area, it presents a highly tailorable framework and can match an assessment's geographic scope. It is a structured approach, but the structure may change appropriately with each new interpretation.

Outside partners are using the OHI in their own assessments. These are modifications and interpretations of the original Global Assessments conducted for the first time in 2012 (Halpern *et al.* 2012). The methods have improved since then, and collaborators have changed their goals, models, and data in their own assessments in the ever-evolving OHI process. This **Conceptual Guide** will help you understand the reasoning behind the framework, and will allow you to prepare to make use of local information to get the best results possible for your assessment once you are ready to engage with the data.

The benefits provided by the ocean have most commonly been measured through these broadly held public goals:

- [**Food provision**](FP_Philosophy) from sustainably harvested or cultured stocks
- [**Artisanal opportunities**](AO_Philosophy) for local communities from sustainable practices
- [**Natural products**](NP_Philosophy), including pharmaceuticals and decorative materials, that are sustainably extracted
- [**Carbon storage**](CS_Philosophy) in coastal habitats
- [**Coastal protection**](CP_Philosophy) from inundation and erosion
- [**Sense of place**](SP_Philosophy) from culturally valued iconic species, habitats, and landscapes
- [**Livelihoods and economies**](LE_Philosophy) from coastal and ocean-dependent communities
- [**Tourism and recreation**](TR_Philosophy) opportunities
- [**Clean waters**](CW_Philosophy) and beaches for aesthetic and health values
- [**Biodiversity**](BIO_Philosophy) of species and habitats
