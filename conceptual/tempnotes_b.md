### Resilience

#### How to get started?

Key questions:
 * What is resilience?
 * What are the ideal data?
 * How do I find data for resilience?
 * What are some resources I can use?
 * Where can I get started?

#### Local to Global: Regulations at Different Scales

 Environmental regulation exists on many scales. From the local, to the regional, to the global, there are different ways society manages its natural resources, engages in trade, and protects its environment. This makes finding data for this area an opportunity and a challenge. It's an opportunity because there is a wealth of data available for use, but it's also a challenge because the relevance of the data, and the quality of it for your needs, is not guaranteed.

 Global datasets offer insight. Global data are often the easiest to find. But they are the coarsest. You can't compare regions within your assessment area because all regions will have the same value or score, unless it is transformed by population as an indirect measure, or transformed some other way. Global data examples are the World Bank data, World Governance Indicators, World Development Indicators, and any dataset maintained by a United Nations or other inter-governmental organization; these include datasets from UN FAO, UNESCO, JMP/UNICEF, and composite data provided by the Human Development Index, for example.

 > The wealth of international data is growing. For instance, the Millennium Development Goals have inspired much data-collection, such as the UNICEF/JMP's water and sanitation metrics. This is where Global 2012 and following gets its "access to sanitation" metric to assess water cleanliness and ecological pressures. It's also a dataset used in  other composite index assessments at the global scale. Note that the MDGs are expiring in 2015, soon to be replaced by the Sustainable Development Goals, which should bring more traction to international environmental monitoring through metrics. In future assessments, new and better datasets for particular aspects of ocean health and human well-being may become available.

 National-level data are better. These include national laws on the environment, or protection of the marine environment or rivers that lead to coastal waters. National laws include things like the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act in the U.S., or something on the scale of the E.U. Clean Water Directive.

 State or province-level laws also work. This would be looking at the same types of laws and policies that exist on the national level, but they would have been tailored to fit the types of needs of a particular sub-national area. This includes California's own National Environmental Policy Act, or the California Ocean Protection Act, which have laws designed specifically to protect California's environment. This would tell you more relevant information that using data from a national law.

 Local level regulations will provide you with the most accurate information for your assessment.
