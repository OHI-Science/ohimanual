## Resilience

### How to get started?

Key questions:
* What is resilience?
* What are the ideal data?
* How do I find data for resilience?
* What are some resources I can use?
* Where can I get started?

#### Local to Global: Regulations at Different Scales

Environmental regulation exists on many scales. From the local, to the regional, to the global, there are different ways society manages its natural resources, engages in trade, and protects its environment. This makes finding data for this area an opportunity and a challenge. It's an opportunity because there is a wealth of data available for use, but it's also a challenge because the relevance of the data, and the quality of it for your needs, is not guaranteed.

Global datasets offer broad insight. Global data are often the easiest to find with the largest country coverage and consistent methods, but they are the coarsest types of data for you regional assessment. You can't compare regions within your assessment area using global data because all regions will have the same value or score from the global database, unless the value is transformed by each region's population as an indirect measure, or transformed in  some other way. Global database examples are the World Bank data, World Governance Indicators, World Development Indicators, and any dataset maintained by a United Nations or other inter-governmental organization; these include datasets from UN FAO, UNESCO, JMP/UNICEF, and composite information provided by the Human Development Index, for example.

> The wealth of international data is growing. For instance, the Millennium Development Goals have inspired much data-collection, such as the UNICEF/JMP's water and sanitation metrics. This is where Global Assessments gets their "access to sanitation" metric to assess water cleanliness and ecological pressures. It's also a dataset used in  other global composite index assessments. Note that the MDGs are expiring in 2015, soon to be replaced by the Sustainable Development Goals, which should bring more traction to international environmental monitoring and metrics. In future assessments, new and better datasets for particular aspects of ocean health and human well-being may become available.

National-level data are better than global for your assessment. These include national laws on the environment, or protection of the marine environment or rivers that lead to coastal waters. National laws include things like the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act in the U.S., or something on the scale of the E.U. Clean Water Directive.

State or province-level laws also work. This would be looking at the same types of laws and policies that exist on the national level, but they would have been tailored to fit the types of needs of a particular sub-national area. This includes California's own National Environmental Policy Act, or the California Ocean Protection Act, which have laws designed specifically to protect California's environment. This would tell you more relevant information that using data from a national law.

Local level regulations will provide you with the most accurate information for your assessment.

#### Scoring: Turning Qualitative into Quantitative

There are several ways to turn the qualitative information of regulations and social actions into quantiative metrics for analysis.

The simplest way is to give credit for having a resilience measure in place. This means assigning a binary score of zero or one for presence versus absence of the resilience measure. For international conventions, this can be done by assigning 1 for having signed a convention; an additional score can be given for countries that have further *ratified* a convention; this is one way to further differentiate scores.

A more robust way is to give credit for different aspects of the resilience measures. In addition to a score for having the law, policy, etc., in place, it is possible to gauge the effectiveness of that policy.


#### Data sources: Typology of Laws, Policies, Regulations

<!---See Courtney's Google Doc-->


Environmental laws and policies offer concrete information.

Administrative law. Land-use law is also important to the integration of environmental law; zoning laws relevant for coastal areas;

Insurance policies present another option. Coastal areas are increasingly requiring climate-related insurance in some countries, for instance.

Social initiatives also present another way to tackle resilience. There might be a beach clean-up day, a percentage of the refuse material that is recycled by the population, or some other social factor that reduces trash inputs into the ocean. A local law banning plastic bags is another way that local jurisdictions control plastic trash.

> In the Brazil study (2014), the marine trash resilience was calculated by counting up whether localities had one of four garbage management services, including access to beach clean-up services, household garbage collection, household recycling collection, and garbage collection in public streets. <!---Julie's MS--->


#### Examples of Resilience Metrics

#### Case Study: High Seas Assessment (2014)

#### Case Study: Israel (2014)

Used same resilience layers as Global Study (Halepern 2013) (is this true?]. Most resilience measures were applied to Biodiversity, except for climate change regulatons and gas prices.

**Ecological**
* CDB Water
* Habitat resilience
* Used in Food Provision, Artisanal Opportunity, Coastal Protection
* Fishing Resilience
* CBD Tourism
* Used in Biodiversity ( = Sand dunes, Soft bottom, Species)
* CBD Mariculture
* Biodiversity, Food Provision
* CBD Alien Species
* Biodiversity
* Trujillo (2008) regulations
* CITES signatories
* Diversity Indices

**Social**
* World Governance Indicators


#### Case Study: U.S. West Coast (2014)

The U.S. West Coast assessment . (2014) used a tailor-made set of resilience metrics. These were more informative than the global metrics in that that reflected the policy response to the local context... etc.


#### Questions

* What laws or regulations are in place that would mitigate pressures? <!---from Julie's MS--->

<!---From Courtney's GoogleDoc--->

* 1. Does a regulation exist that appropriately addresses a specific pressure?
   * Assign a score of 0 or 1
 * Is the regulation being appropriately complied with?
    * Additional score of 0 or 1. For instance, the CBD surveys will tell you this kind of information. So will various "scorecards" or compliance assessments by interested third parties (e.g., Transparency International's Corruption Index)
 * Are there mechanisms in place supporting enforcement of the regulations?
    * e.g., CITES convention has a clause that causes parties to restrict trade with countries that are not complying with the convention
