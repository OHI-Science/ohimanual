##**Understand scales of assessment: Global & Independent (OHI+)**

![Scores are calculated for each region and combined to produce a total score for the study area. Data or indicators are required for every region.](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1RsamVf-p5nSUS8_w--uU5I2717tqMPlhc3JEbW8Rvkg/pub?w=677&h=446)


###Assessements can be carried out at different scales

> Remember: The OHI should guide your efforts, rather than direct them. 

Your assessment will be an example of an Ocean Health Index+ (OHI+) assessment. OHI+ assessments and are conducted by independent groups such as yours that use the same Index approach to measure ocean health in their own regions, countries, states, and communities. These assessments can be used by managers to incorporate local information and priorities at the spatial scale where policy and management decisions are made.

Index scores by goal are calculated at the scale of the reporting unit, which is called a ‘region’ and then combined using a weighted average to produce the score for the overall area assessed, called a ‘study area’. In the global assessments the study area is the world and the regions assessed are coastal countries or territories (two hundred twenty one exclusive economic zones), Antarctica, and the high seas (fifteen sub divisions). Global assessments are conducted by a multidisciplinary team of scientists led by the U.S. National Center for Ecological Assessment and Synthesis (NCEAS), Conservation International, and the Seas Around Us Project. These studies are published annually and use models developed using the best existing data available a the global scale to capture each goal philosophy. At the global level, we apply the same methods and reference points to all regions assessed equally, which ensures scientific objectivity and allows for comparison of performance across countries. The methods are improved every year by increasing goal model robustness, integrating new data, and recalculating the scores with the improved methods both for the current year and, retroactively, for previous years to allow for year to year comparisons.

###Comparing Scales of Assessment

It is important to note that the scores form you OHI+ assessment can't be compared directly to the scores from global assessments. This is because your models and data will be different, which means that your methods  are unique to your area. However, you can compare the scores for the same assessment area through time and make truly quantitative comparisons. Understanding this should allow you to be creative as you develop your plans going into your assessment.
