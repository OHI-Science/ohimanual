## **Food Provision**

> The aim of **Food Provision** is to optimize the sustainable level of seafood harvest in your region's waters.

The aim of this goal is to maximize the sustainable harvest of seafood in regional waters from **Wild-Caught Fisheries** and **Mariculture**, or ocean-farmed seafood. Regions are rewarded for maximizing the amount of sustainable seafood provided and they are penalized for unsustainable practices or for under-harvest. Because fisheries and mariculture are separate industries with very different features, each is tracked separately as a unique sub-goal under **Food Provision**. They are then combined after each sub-goal is weighted by the proportion of the total yield it contributes to total food provision.

### **Wild-Caught Fisheries**

>The **Wild-Caught Fisheries** sub-goal describes the amount of wild-caught seafood harvested and its sustainability for human consumption. Higher scores reflect fishing practices with sustainably high yields that avoid excessively high exploitation and do not target threatened existing fish populations.

#### Philosophy

This sub-goal measures the ability to obtain maximal wild harvests without damaging the ocean's ability to continue providing similar quantities of fish for people in the future. The optimal levels are described by Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). Higher scores reflect fishing practices with sustainably high yields that avoid excessively high exploitation, or overfishing, and do not target threatened populations. Regions are penalized for resources that are either underfished or overfished because both of these conditions detract from the overall achievement of maximized food provision.

Wild-caught fisheries harvests must remain below levels that would compromise the resource and its future harvest, but the amount of seafood harvested should be maximized within the bounds of sustainability. The reference point is set with a functional relationship. This calculation model aims to assess the amount of wild-caught seafood that can be sustainably harvested, with sustainability defined by multi-species yield, and with penalties assigned for both over- and under-harvesting. This is a departure from traditional conservation goals regarding wild-caught fisheries where under-harvesting is usually not penalized. In other circumstances, penalties are only given for over-harvesting, such as in the case for concerned fisheries managers who use over-harvesting as a way to guide enforcement. In the case of OHI, however, the idea is to assess the delivery of a sustainable benefit or the missed opportunity for one, and therefore any distance from the optimum is a penalty.

This sub-goal can interact with other goals and sub-goals through, for example through the destruction of surrounding habitats that can  decrease the productivity of farmed fisheries indirectly.

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally, data for catch size and amount of effort of every commercially- and recreationally-fished species would be available for a place, as well as the functional relationship between the fish population's size in terms of biomass, and fisheries catch effort. This would allow an accurate MSY to be calculated appropriate for the region. Then, fisheries catch and effort information would be used to calculate the present state and MSY would be used to set the reference point. Current status would be calculated using the present state of every species in turn and then combining each species together to get a weighted proportion of the total catch.

#### Keep in Mind

The assessment sustainability, of course, depends on the quality of the underlying stock assessments. Better methods for data-poor stocks had been developed in Global 2013, improving upon those developed for Global 2012. When better data are available and local experts have produced formal stock assessments, better-informed models can be developed, as was done in U.S. West Coast study (2014).

This sub-goal also cannot determine whether the set-points are optimum for other parts of system. For example, this model does not address food security more broadly because this goal does not assess where or by whom the catch is being consumed, and it does not assess nutrition quality either. Potentially, the outcome from assessing the **Food Provision** goal could be used as input if a separate 'food security assessment' were developed.

### **Mariculture**

>**Mariculture** measures the ability to reach the highest levels of seafood gained from far-raised facilities without damaging the ocean's ability to provide fish sustainably now and in the future.

#### Philosophy

Mariculture practices must be sustainable and also maximize the amount of food production that is physically possible and desired by regional governments and those who buy, sell and eat that food. This sub-goal shows whether or not maximal seafood yield from farm-raised facilities is occurring without damaging the ocean’s ability to continue providing fish for people in the future. It is founded on the idea that mariculture practices must not inhibit the future production of seafood in the area.

Higher scores mean that food provisioning is being done in a sustainable manner while not compromising the water quality in the farmed area and not relying on wild populations to feed or replenish the cultivated species. A score of 100 means that a region is sustainably harvesting the greatest amount of farmed seafood possible based on its own maximum potential relative to the conditions of the assessment. As for **Wild-Caught Fisheries**, a low score can indicate one of two things – that species are either being farmed in an unsustainable manner, or that assessed areas are not maximizing the potential to farm in their waters.

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally, information on the spatial area available for mariculture would be available, as well as data on the sustainability of that production. Availability could be determined by social expectations and priorities, not just geographical space. This would mean that data are available for the physical coastal and offshore habitat appropriate for each intended type of mariculture service and that areas have been identified as socially appropriate. At a regional scale, better data should demonstrate any restrictions based on habitat, conflicting uses, and social preferences.

#### Keep in Mind

This approach would not necessarily penalize regions that have less geographic area available for mariculture, because it is relative to what is marked as available. However, places with fewer sheltered bays or lower primary production, for example, could be at a disadvantage compared to places that have more favorable conditions.

The appropriateness of the approach will also vary depending on the geography and what's socially desirable. For instance, in the Global 2012 study, China's ratio of area dedicated to mariculture production relative to area available showed the highest score and therefore became the reference point against which other countries' values were compared. Simply maximizing isn't always desirable, however. The social component is important because mariculture competes for space with many other ocean uses, including other kinds of fishing and tourism activities. This sub-goal reveals linkages among ocean health issues.

>As another example, Global 2012 did not have information about social limitations for how much coastal area could be allotted to mariculture, and therefore it included the entire area of the coastline in the calculation. This assumed that mariculture could be developed everywhere, which isn't always socially desirable.
