## **Determine the Need and Purpose of Conducting Your OHI+ Assessment**

> Remember that producing the Index is not the end in itself--the  aim is to *achieving improved ocean health.*

OHI+ is applied research, aiming at solving practical problems related to ocean and coastal resource management. One of your first tasks when developing an OHI+ assessment should be to define the purpose of the study and think about how it can complement other or planned efforts of environmental management. Assessments should be conducted with clear research questions in mind--*how will what you are doing help achieve improved ocean health? How will it solve the problems you want to solve?*

One clear way to think about this is in choosing your study area and the regions that will comprise it. Will your regions match the scales of decision-making, will they match biogeography, or will they try to fit both? Will this require new data, or will it require involvement and the collaboration of neighboring countries?

* See [the Baltic Health Index](http://www.su.se/ostersjocentrum/english/baltic-eye/research/baltic-health-index) for an example of regional collaboration.

Once you have a sense of your regions of interest, you should also consider whether other efforts are already underway to manage those areas and whether researchers are active in the area. This could lead to new opportunities for collaboration, and for chances support new data-collection efforts. You should Identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in your area on both the scientific and the policy scale where possible.

> When conducting an OHI+ assessment, remember that the process is just as important as the results.

Defining the end-goals of the study will largely determine how goal models, data gathering, and reference points are developed to maximize the utility of the findings to inform decision-making, and is very important in ensuring a smooth and successful project with OHI+.
