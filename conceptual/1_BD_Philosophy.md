##**Biodiversity**

> The **Biodiversity** goal captures the conservation status of marine species.

**Biodiversity** measures the condition of species and key habitats that support species richness and diversity. It is is measured through two sub-goals: **Species** and **Habitats**. Species were assessed because they are what one typically thinks of in relation to biodiversity, and people value biodiversity in particular for its existence value. But because only a small proportion of marine species worldwide have been mapped and scientifically assessed, habitats are used a proxy for the condition of the broad number of species that depend on them. A simple average of these two sub-goal scores produces the **Biodiversity** goal score in the Global Assessment.

###**Species**

> The **Species** sub-goal aims to estimate how successfully the richness and variety of marine life is being maintained.

#### Philosophy

The **Species** sub-goal aims to estimate how successfully the richness and variety of marine life is being maintained. People value the species that comprise marine biodiversity for their existence value as well as their contributions to resilient ecosystem structure and function. The risk of species extinction generates great emotional and moral concern for many as well.

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally, data would be available on the number of species in each region of a study area, along with their habitat ranges, and assessments of their population size or conservation status. The conservations status should be undertaken by a trusted authority, such as the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

> China, for example, has its own equivalent to the IUCN **Red List** of Endangered Species. If a country has conducted its own species surveys and assigned categories of risk, that information may be more useful than the global data not specialized to the local context.

#### Keep in Mind

The **Species** sub-goal is conceptually equal to iconic species, but it includes all species that are scientifically assessed. This will limit your data to those species that have this kind of information. The species data  layers in the Global Assessments included the amount of area where each species is present, so that species that inhabit a greater area have a greater weight in the calculations than those with a smaller range. This was different from the **Iconic Species** approach.

Note that **Biodiversity** can also play a supporting role in **Food Provision** and sustainability generally, and is therefore also included in the resilience dimensions of other public goals.

###**Habitats**

> The **Habitats** sub-goal measures the condition of habitats that are important for supporting a wide array of species diversity.

#### Philosophy

This sub-goal measures some of the habitats that are particularly important in supporting large numbers of marine species. Habitats are areas where animals can thrive and bring further positive benefits--whether for existence value or for other enjoyment. The amount of area needed to ensure biodiversity varies with habitat type and animal size, so therefore this is an indirect approach to representing the status of biodiversity.

> TIP: It would be possible to remove this sub-goal, in fact, if perfect data on assessed species were available, because this sub-goal is a proxy for the other half of the **Biodiversity** goal.

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally, information on the extent and condition of every single habitat type would be available through time. The reference point for habitat-based goals will likely be temporal, meaning means that historic data are needed such that current habitat and value data can be compared to historic data.

#### Keep in Mind

This sub-goal is methodologically similar to the **Carbon Storage** goal but it includes all habitats with sufficient data for this goal, not just those habitats that sequester carbon. It's also a

> TIP: Consider approaching this goal with **Carbon Storage** and other spatially explicitly goals, when conducting your assessment in Phase Three.
