#**Task Timeline**

> TIP: The process of conducing an OHI+ assessment is not necessarily linear.

The Task Timeline provides the steps involved in conducting Ocean Health Index assessments. It also recommends the the types of skills needed. The process of calculating the Index is not linear. There is a lot of iteration and discussion among the team, which consists of scientists, computer programmers, and a core management team, who must all work together to arrive at the best decisions possible. For example, gathering appropriate data for each status, pressure, and resilience layer requires serious thinking about how to calculate reference points at the same time as determining the validity and usability of the dataset. It is expected that your data sources and goal models will change during the process.

The Task Timeline outlines four phases for the OHI+ process. It shows the proposed roles required for a team. Although there is a suggested timeline, the amount of time actually required required to do an assessment will vary depend on a number of factors--time is often limited, for example, by the availability of data and the number of people working on the assessment. The process may be slowed by unforeseen challenges such as technical issues with software.

The phases and tasks outlined in the Task Timeline are:

- **Phase 1:** Learn about the OHI
- **Phase 2:** Plan an OHI+ Assessment
- **Phase 3:** Conduct the OH+ Assessment
- **Phase 4:** Communicate
