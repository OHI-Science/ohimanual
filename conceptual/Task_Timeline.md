#**Task Timeline**

> TIP: The process of conducing an OHI+ assessment is not necessarily a linear one.

The Task Timeline shows the steps required in conducting Ocean Health Index assessments. It gives an overview of the **Phases** of the project timeline and the colorations are recommendations for the types of skills needed at different stages of the process. The amount of time actually required required to do an assessment will vary depend on a number of factors. Time is limited, for example, by the ease of data availability and the number of people working on the assessment.

>The process may be slowed by unforeseen challenges such as technical issues with software and dead-ends in the data search, for example.

When conducting an assessment, is it useful to use this timeline as a guide and roadmap, knowing that it is not the only way to do the process. The process of calculating the Index is not a linear one. here is a lot of iteration and discussion among the team, which consists of scientists, computer programmers, and a core management team, who must all work together to arrive at the best decisions possible. For example, gathering appropriate data for each status, pressure, and resilience layer requires serious thinking about how to calculate reference points at the same time as determining the validity and usability of the dataset. It is expected that your data sources and goal models will change during the process. The process of conducting an assessment is a scientific process that requires careful consideration and detailed documentation of the decision-making. In fact, most of that work must occur before the tools such as the OHI Toolbox and accompanying WebApp are used.

> TIP: Before you engage with the tools in Phase Three, you should engage in Phase One and Phase Two of the process.

The phases and tasks outlined in the Task Timeline are:

- **Phase 1:** **Learn** about the OHI
- **Phase 2:** **Plan** an OHI+ Assessment
- **Phase 3:** **Conduct** the OH+ Assessment
- **Phase 4:** **Communicate** and Inform
