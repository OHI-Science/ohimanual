#**Task Timeline**

<!---This page needs to be updated--->

The Task Timeline provides the steps involved in conducting Ocean Health Index assessments. It also suggests the types of skills required while doing so. The process of calculating the Index is not necessarily linear: there is a lot of iteration and discussion among the team to make the best decisions. For example, gathering appropriate data for each status, pressure, and resilience layer requires thinking about how to calculate their reference points at the same time. It is possible that data sources will need to change during the process and goal models will have to be modified as well.

The Task Timeline outlines three phases that occur through time. The time required will depend on the availability of data, the number of people working on the assessment, as well as challenges that may arise. Tasks are indicated by skill set but many decisions will also occur as a team.

The phases and tasks outlined in the Task Timeline are:

- **Phase 1:**Learn
- **Phase 2:**Plan
- **Phase 3:**Conduct
- **Phase 4:**Communicate

Further supporting documentation, including examples, will be available for many of these steps soon.
