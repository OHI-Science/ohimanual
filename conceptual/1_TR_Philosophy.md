## **Tourism and Recreation**

> The **Tourism and Recreation** goal captures the value people have for experiencing and taking pleasure in coastal areas.

#### Philosophy

This goal measures the value people have for experiencing and taking pleasure in coastal and ocean areas. Tourism, travel, and recreation are major drivers of thriving coastal communities and they also offer a measure of how much people value ocean systems. By electing to visit a coastal area rather than an inland area, people express their preference for visiting these places over others. Ideally, tourism and recreation could continue indefinitely if it is done in a sustainable manner.

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally there would be data available specifically for employment in coastal tourism industries, however the best data available at a global scale report total number of jobs, not just coastal jobs, within the travel and tourism industries. These data include jobs that are directly connected to the tourism and travel industry, for both leisure and business. This could include accommodation services, food and beverage services, retail trade, transportation services, and cultural, sports and recreational services, and could exclude investment industries and suppliers. There would also be information on how the ocean is used for enjoyment by both local residents and tourists, thereby capturing the full value of touristic and recreational activities.

#### Keep in Mind

**Tourism and Recreation** does not include the revenue or livelihoods that are generated by tourism and recreation; that is captured in the **Livelihoods and Economies** goal.  This goal is not about the economic benefits, but instead about the value that people have for experiencing and enjoying coastal areas.

Models will vary greatly depending on data available; there are many ways to potentially measure the delivery of this goal.

> Unfortunately it was not possible to determine the proportion of jobs affiliated with strictly leisure travel in the Global 2013, for example. It was assumed all travel and tourism employment was related to tourism and recreation values. Additionally, it is true that not every tourist stays in a hotel and not everyone staying in a hotel is a tourist.
