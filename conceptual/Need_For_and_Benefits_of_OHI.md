# **Need for and Benefits of an Ocean Heath Index**

> The Index is the first assessment tool that provides a common platform for scientifically combining and comparing key elements from all dimensions of the oceans health to measure how sustainably people are using the ocean.

Marine management today  requires establishing comprehensive management objectives that maximize sustainable production while at the same time maintaining healthy oceans. This requires a cycle of measuring conditions, developing and enacting strategic responses, and continuous monitoring. The Ocean Health Index (OHI, or 'the Index') was developed to support this growing need by providing a framework that quantifies overall ecosystem health. The Index is the first assessment tool that provides a common platform for scientifically combining and comparing key elements from all dimensions of the oceans health — biological, physical, economic, and social – to measure how sustainably people are using the ocean.

Overall Index scores are a combination of components, known as **Goals**, of ocean health. The goal scores are calculated using the best available data and indicators at the spatial scale of the assessment. Scores reflect how well coastal regions optimize their potential ocean benefits and services in a sustainable way relative to a reference point or policy target, on a scale of 0 to 100. The Index was developed as a framework to assess coastal oceans in a formulaic manner, and was designed to be customizable given different scales, data availabilities, and cultural priorities. In this way, it can be tailored to fit any spatial context to meet both ecological and political needs.

While building the Index is a structured approach, the approach is scalable and the structure may change adaptively with each new assessment. The Index compares scores within an area's scope and provides a consistent platform from which to conduct assessments through time. It measures and track changes in the various dimensions through a process that is repeatable, transparent, quantitative, and goal-driven. By combining ocean and coastal benefits under a single framework, then, the Index allows for a comprehensive and integrated view of marine systems as well as a better understanding of potential trade-offs or synergies among these goals.

#### How is OHI Different?

While many indices have been created to track particular issues or trends in economics, social science, or environmental quality, the Ocean Health Index is the first to define and track ocean health comprehensively. It recognizes that people are part of the ocean ecosystem, and evaluates how well the ocean provides key benefits to people now and how likely they are to occur in the future. Part of the success of future benefits comes from present actions taken safeguard ocean health now, and this is given credit in the scores. This index is different from other indicator-based monitoring systems such as the Millennium Development Goals because other systems contain indicators which individually assess performance in a particular task, sector, or topic. Performing successfully in many or all categories undoubtedly improves overall performance, but does not provide information on the relationship between the different indicators and sectors evaluated.

As a composite index, the Ocean Health Index integrates the results for and relationships between all categories that it evaluates. By integrating information across disciplines and sectors, the Index represents a significant advance over conventional single-sector approaches to assessing ocean condition. As a management tool, the Index can inform decision-making by helping stakeholders identify geographic and thematic priorities for management, which increases the cost-effectiveness of actions taken. At the same time, it addresses the desire for policymakers to increase environmental performance in the face of tightening budget constraints for natural resource management and conservation, and galvanizes efforts towards ecosystem-based management.
