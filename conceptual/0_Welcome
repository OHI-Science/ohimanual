# Welcome to OHI+

You are here because you would like to plan an independent ocean health assessment for your area. The Ocean Health Index+ (OHI+) approach allows you to use the framework of the OHI using the metrics and information tailored to your region.

This platform will allow you to create and use an OHI+ assessment as a decision-support tool and for ecosystem monitoring. Perhaps you are here because you are hoping to conduct an evaluation of the health of your area, or area actively engaging in ecosystem-based management. By the end of your assessment, you will have established a baseline estimation of the status of your ocean health, and and you can use that information to determine how well you are meeting, exceeding, goal targets in certain indicators.

In any case, the process of conducting an OHI+ is as valuable as the results because of the way in which you can use it to synthesize collections of data, scientific findings, and management efforts. An important theme throughout this process it to find metrics that are meaningful your area.
