## **Interactions: Pressures and Resilience**

Pressures and resilience layers interact with an indicator to increase or decrease its likely future state. The real-world goal of having resilience measures is to lead to an increase in the likely future state, although this can also be achieved through a decrease in the pressures as well. Either way, the most desired outcome for any goal is intended to improve the overall score. This would be most visible through multiple years of engagement with an OHI assessment.

Ecological and social resilience are assessed separately and then combined to determine the goal score. This is usually  done with equal weighting, but that could be changed if expert opinion recommended otherwise. Any new resilience measure must be associated with a pressures layer regardless of the weighting, such that, ideally, any pressure on the environment has a countervailing mitigation action. The assessment will use this relationship, and the underlying data, to ultimately convey which is more effective.

**The figure below** shows stressors by category, and the resilience measures meant to 'balance' (or counteract) them for the global assessment. Note that resilience layers are only available for some categories and goals in the Global case, highlighting the importance of data availability for these layers. Also, some resilience measures are goal-specific; that is, they act on certain goals without counteracting pressures. When you have regulations to improve the practices captured in the status specific goals (e.g., sustainable tourism, lower bycatch, etc.), you can include them as resilience measures.

![Each resilience data layer should have a corresponding pressures layer, and vice versa. Note that a pressure layer becomes (1-resilience) in cases where only resilience data are available, due to data limitations.](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/19ZBIhzTrNlumV9ZhCmsdEcvybFHp-eN5P5IFAsFmql0/pub?w=558&h=721)

Pressures and resilience are ultimately important for scores, but they have a smaller contribution to the overall scores because we can only approximate their effects. Individual pressures are ranked for their importance to different goals based on published studies and expert opinion. Resilience actions are the best way to improve a score, because they can reduce pressures, protect ocean habitats and species, improve status, and optimize benefits to people.

 Pressures and resilience are usually summarized across ecological and social pressure categories in order to reveal the influence of any one factor that might be present. The this way, for example, pressures from pollution, habitat destruction, fishing pressure, species pollution, and climate change will have a cumulative impact on the scores.
