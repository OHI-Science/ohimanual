##**Understanding Pressures**A pressure is any kind of stressor on the social or ecological system that is harmful for ocean health.Pressures can change how goals interact with each other. For example, raising fish in the **Mariculture** sub-goal can cause genetic escapes, which are a pressure on the **Wild-Caught Fisheries** and **Species** sub-goals. The genetic escapes do not affect mariculture itself, however, and have no effect on that particular sub-goal score while they do have a negative effect on the other sub-goal scores.Pressures are calcuated as the sum of the ecological and social pressures that negatively affect goal scores. The Index framework calculates pressures by first grouping them into five ecological categories (pollution, habitat destruction, fishing pressure, species pollution, and climate change) and one social category. The reason there are categories is to minimize sampling bias, so that no one kind disproportionately influences the score. They are weighted equally in the global assessment, but in your local assessment they can be changed if there is enough information on how to do so.
