# **Task Timeline**

> TIP: The process of conducing an OHI+ assessment is not necessarily a linear one.

The phases and tasks outlined in the Task Timeline are:

- **Phase 1:** **Learn** about the OHI
- **Phase 2:** **Plan** an OHI+ Assessment
- **Phase 3:** **Conduct** the OH+ Assessment
- **Phase 4:** **Communicate** and Inform

The Task Timeline shows the steps recommended in conducting Ocean Health Index assessments. It gives an overview of the **Phases** of the project and the colors offer recommendations for the types of skills needed at different stages of the process. The amount of time actually required required to do an assessment will vary depend on a number of factors, such as the ease of data access and the number of people working on the assessment. The process may be slowed by unforeseen challenges such as technical issues with software and dead-ends in the data search, among other things.

When conducting an assessment, is it useful to use this timeline as a guide and roadmap, knowing that it is not the only way to do the process. It is a useful however because it is grounded in experience with ongoing projects. It is important to keep in mind that the process of calculating the Index is not a linear one, as there is a lot of iteration and discussion among the team to arrive at the best decisions. The team will usually consist of scientists, programmers, and a core management team, who must all work together to produce the results. For example, gathering appropriate data for each status, pressure, and resilience layer requires serious thinking about how to calculate reference points while at the same time as determining the validity and usability of the datasets.

It is expected that your data sources and goal models will change during the process, and this is entirely normal. The process of conducting an assessment is a scientific one and good documentation to track the decision-making will support the validity of the results. In fact, many careful considerations must made even before using the OHI tools such as the Toolbox and WebApp (see the **OHI Manual** in **Phase Three**.)

> TIP: Before you engage with the tools in Phase Three, you should engage with Phases One and Two.
