# Phase Two: Plan an OHI Assessment

> **Phase two** is intended to help you organize the appropriate resources and gather the key stakeholders, so conducting the assessment is as smooth of a process as possible. Remember that an effective assessment will include the input, values, and perspectives from stakeholders of various backgrounds, so it is important you spend time identifying who should be involved in the process and discussions. Also, it is important that you have a good understanding of the time commitment, the required funds, and the human resources needed to successfully develop your assessment. Although not necessary, we recommend you develop a proposal or working plan for your assessment, as this will help you and those involved to keep the activities along a pre-established timeline.
