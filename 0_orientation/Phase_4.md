# Phase Four: Communicate and Inform Decision Making

> **Phase 4** will give you guidelines and recommendations on how to communicate your findings, engage key stakeholders to discuss the findings, as well as allow decision-makers and managers to understand the consequences of different management scenarios. This section is not intended to be prescriptive, but rather suggestive. Therefore, you should not limit yourself to our recommendations, but instead use them as ideas to complement your own strategy for discussing the results of the assessment and developing policies and management interventions that respond to the priorities identified in the study.

This section will guide you on :

- Outreach and communications
- Outreach strategy
- Disseminating findings
- Communicate results with partners and others
- Develop and implement policies and management interventions that respond to the priorities
- Monitor and re-evaluate to determine policy effectiveness and set new priorities
