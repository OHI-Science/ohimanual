# Welcome to the Ocean Health Index+ Independent Assessment Portal <!--- portal or platform? --->

Welcome to the Ocean Health Index (OHI) Portal orientation. Here, you will learn how to use the portal and how to access the tools and information available to you to facilitate the development of your Ocean Health Index independent assessment (OHI+).

The phases in this portal are designed to build your capacity to autonomously develop an an assessment. The information is organized along the four interdependent phases of an OHI+ assessment:

- **Phase 1 Learn about OHI**: understand the philosophy and conceptual underpinnings of the Ocean Health Index framework and establish the motivation for conducting your study
- **Phase 2 Plan an OHI+ Assessment**: develop a robust project action plan or proposal, detailing your objectives, activities, resources needed, and timeline
- **Phase 3 Conduct the OH+ Assessment**: engage with the science, find data and indicators, modify goal models, and use the Ocean Health Index Toolbox to synthesize information, modify parameters, establish targets, and calculate scores.
- **Phase 4 Communicate and Inform Decision Making**: engage key stakeholders to interpret findings and identify priority themes and areas for management intervention

> Note: The amount of time required to do an OHI+ Assessment will vary depending on local processes

Following the steps in this portal will allow you to create and use an OHI+ assessment as a decision-support tool, monitor the status and trends of all ocean and coastal elements (ecological, economic, social, and physical), and understand the consequences of management and policy interventions.

The reasons for conducting an assessment vary from context to context. Perhaps you want to better understand ocean and coastal health in your region, or you are actively engaging in ecosystem-based management, or you are facilitating a multi-stakeholder collaborative planning and target setting process. Regardless of your reasons, you can use this portal so at the end of your assessment, you will have established a baseline estimation of the status of ocean health in your study area, and use that information to determine how well you are meeting, exceeding, goal targets in certain indicators.

We strongly recommend that you capitalize on the opportunity of this assessment to make it a participatory process. In our experiences engaging with various countries around the world, the most effective assessments are those where the process of conducting the assessment was just as valuable (if not more) than the final results. This is because the assessment process serves as a forum to engage stakeholders from multiple backgrounds (scientific, civil society, government, private sector, NGOs, etc.) to discuss local preferences and priorities, understand the interactions between various activities, and collaboratively establish management targets.

On the technical side, the process is also valuable because it allows the users to synthesize collections of data, scientific findings, and management efforts. An important theme throughout this process it to find metrics that are meaningful your area.
> TIP: Before you engage with the tools in Phase Three, you should engage with Phases One and Two.

## Target Audience
Developing an assessment requires skillsets from various backgrounds (we discuss this with more detail in Phase 2). This portal is intended for different audiences with different backgrounds. ** Phases 1, 2, and 4 ** are intended for project managers and scientific analysts alike, while **Phase 3** is very technical and is aimed at a scientific audience. Due to this multidisciplinary nature, it is important that you assemble a team that can work well in a collaboratively setting.

## How to use this portal: the Task Timeline

When conducting an assessment, is it useful to use our timeline as a guide, knowing that the amount of time required to do an assessment will vary. This portal is structured around the OHI+ Task Timeline, which defines the tasks involved in each phase. When conducting an assessment, the OHI+ Task Timeline is useful as a guide and roadmap since was created based in the experiences of past and ongoing projects. However, there are many pathways to achieve the same outcome, so this process is strongly recommended, but not mandatory. Do notice, however, that the **process of conducing an OHI+ assessment is not necessarily a linear one**, that is, many tasks take place throughout multiple phases, or require you to adapt and redefine elements throughout the process as there is a lot of iteration and discussion among the team to arrive at the best decisions. We encourage you to use the Task Timeline along with this portal to understand where you are along the process of your assessment and to ensure you are not missing any steps. It is important to keep in mind that the process of conducting the assessment requires collaboration and iteration among your team to arrive at the best results possible. The process of conducting an assessment is a scientific one and good documentation to track the decision-making along the way will support the validity of the results.

The Task Timeline shows the steps recommended in conducting Ocean Health Index assessments. It gives an overview of the **Phases** of the project and the colors offer recommendations for the types of skills needed at different stages of the process. The amount of time actually required required to do an assessment will vary depend on a number of factors, such as the ease of data access and the number of people working on the assessment. The process may be slowed by unforeseen challenges such as technical issues with software and dead-ends in the data search, among other things.

The team will usually consist of scientists, programmers, and a core management team (or working group), who must all work together to produce the results. For example, gathering appropriate data for each status, pressure, and resilience layer requires serious thinking about how to calculate reference points while at the same time as determining the validity and usability of the datasets.

It is expected that your data sources and goal models will change during the process, and this is entirely normal. The process of conducting an assessment is a scientific one and good documentation to track the decision-making will support the validity of the results. In fact, many careful considerations must made even before using the OHI tools such as the Toolbox and WebApp (see the **OHI Manual** in **Phase Three**.)
