# A brief introduction to the Ocean Health Index

> The Ocean Health Index (OHI) is the first assessment framework that provides a common platform for scientifically combining and comparing all key elements from all dimensions of the ocean (ecological, social, economic, and physical) to measure how sustainably people are using ocean and coastal resources.

> In the OHI framework **a healthy ocean is one that sustainably delivers a range of benefits to people now and in the future.**

Marine management today requires establishing comprehensive management objectives that maximize the ocean-derived benefits delivered to people while at the same time keeping oceans healthy. This requires a dynamic cycle of understanding current conditions, developing and enacting strategic management, and understanding how conditions have changed in response. In tandem, there is a growing global trend to developing ecological, social, and economic indicators to measure and track changes on various issues. However, this approach does not capture the interactions that exist between all of these fields.

OHI was developed to support these growing needs by providing a framework that quantifies how well ocean-derived benefits are delivered to people now and in the future. The Index provides a common platform to measure how sustainably people are using the ocean. The Index integrates information (data and indicators) from various fields into a single framework and offers various metrics to allow decision-makers to determine the appropriate balance of priorities among multiple uses to ensure that oceans can continue to sustainably deliver a range of benefits and services to people now and in the future. The framework also allows users to better understand the cumulative pressures and resilience factors affecting, both negatively and positively, the status of various ocean elements. By synthesizing all of these parameters in a single framework, the Index offers users a comprehensive and integrated view of marine systems as a way to understand the trade-offs and synergies among various goals. This represents a significant advance over conventional single-sector approaches to assessing sustainability as communicated through other kinds of index efforts.

The framework is structured around ten clearly defined **goals** coupled with the **likely future state**, which is affected by the social and ecological **pressures** and **resilience** that influence ocean health. The Index was developed as a framework to assess coastal oceans in a formulaic manner, and was designed to be customizable given different scales, data availabilities, and cultural priorities. In this way, it can be tailored to fit any spatial context to meet both ecological and political needs.
Scores are calculated using input from key stakeholders, as well as the best available science and local information (data and indicators) at the scale of the assessment. Scores reflect how well coastal regions optimize their potential ocean benefits and services in a sustainable way relative to a reference point or policy target, on a scale of 0 to 100. A score of 100 means that the evaluated system achieved its defined target for that goal and is sustainably delivering all of the specified benefits and is likely to continue doing so in the near future. A score of 0 means that data were available, but that the region assessed either did not achieve any of the available benefits or that the benefits it did obtain were gained in an unsustainable manner.

As a composite index, OHI integrates the results across disciplines and sectors and expresses them through broadly-held public goals:

- [**Food Provision**](FP_Philosophy) from sustainably harvested or cultured fish stocks
- [**Artisanal Fishing Opportunities**](AO_Philosophy) for local communities to engage in sustainable practices
- [**Natural Products**](NP_Philosophy) that are sustainably extracted from the ocean
- [**Carbon Storage**](CS_Philosophy) in coastal habitats
- [**Coastal Protection**](CP_Philosophy) from inundation and erosion
- [**Sense of Place**](SP_Philosophy) from culturally valued iconic species, habitats, and landscapes
- [**Livelihoods and Economies**](LE_Philosophy) from coastal and ocean-dependent communities
- [**Tourism and Recreation**](TR_Philosophy) opportunities
- [**Clean Waters**](CW_Philosophy) and beaches for aesthetic and health values
- [**Biodiversity**](BIO_Philosophy) of species and habitats

## Why develop an independent assessment and how can the Ocean Health Index be used for decision-making?

The Index is a tailorable approach that can meet the needs and priorities of stakeholders to help inform decision-making on the sustainable use of ocean and coastal resources. Recognizing that most decisions are made at national and subnational scales, our team developed the Ocean Health Index+ (OHI+) independent assessment framework, which is intendend to empower stakeholders to conduct assessments autonomously at any spatial scale desired. The OHI+ framework is repeatable, transparent, quantitative, and goal-driven, and the inputs to the OHI+ assessments use the same overarching framework as OHI global, while utilizing data, indicators, reference points, and preferences and priorities specific to the local context. Repeated assessments are valuable because they can be used to tack and monitor the progress of ocean health through time. Even a first effort of OHI+ is valuable because it establishes a baseline against which to monitor change. Such a flexible framework allows OHI+ assessments to adapt to local conditions while still being useful for management. Researchers from around the world have changed the goals models and data in their assessments in an ever-evolving process that characterizes the Index.

The OHI supports the growing need for marine management to establish comprehensive objectives that maximize the ocean-derived benefits delivered to people while at the same time keeping oceans healthy. As a management tool, the Index can inform decision-making by helping stakeholders identify geographic and thematic priorities for management, which increases the cost-effectiveness of actions taken. At the same time, it addresses the desire for policymakers to increase environmental performance in the face of budget constraints for natural resource conservation, and galvanizes efforts towards ecosystem-based management.
