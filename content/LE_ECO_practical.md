###Practical Considerations

###*Ideal Approach*:

Ideally, economic data would be collected coastally, and traced from sectors both directly and indirectly related to marine industries. When these data are not available it is possible to use revenue data at a larger scale and adapt them to a coastal area based on population distribution. The reference point in this sub-goal will likely be set as a moving window temporal approach.

**History of the Approach (lessons learned 2014)**
<!---Taken from Conceptual Guide v2--->

Economies:
The economies sub-goal is composed of a single component, revenue.

###Recommendations for regional assessments:

In the economies sub-goal, revenue had a moving target temporal comparison; we highly recommend that this remains a temporal comparison so that a specific place is compared to its performance in the past and not to anywhere else.
Model description

**Global 2012:**
This sub-goal is captured as the total adjusted revenue generated directly and indirectly from each sector (measured in 2010 USD), at current and reference time points.

**Global 2013:**
Same as Global 2012, with a few simplifications:  Revenue data were adjusted by dividing by GDP per region (reported in 2013 USD; data from the World Bank).

**Brazil:**
Same as Global 2012.

**US West Coast:**
Same as Global 2012.

####Evolution of the approach:

**Global 2012:**
We assumed that sector-specific job and revenue multipliers are static and globally consistent, but distinct for developed versus developing regions (when such information was available), because we do not have data to resolve temporal or regional differences. For all other sectors where the data sources only provided direct jobs or direct revenue, we used sector- and development status-specific multipliers derived from the literature to estimate total job or revenue impacts. We did not apply multiplier values to wages since the cascading effects of earned income are more contentious.

**Global 2013:**
Same as Global 2012, although simplified where appropriate.

**Brazil:**
Same as Global 2012.

**US West Coast:**
Same as Global 2012.

####The reference point:

**Global 2012:**
In the economies sub-goal, revenue had a moving target temporal comparison.
Because there is no absolute reference point for revenue, this sub-goal employs a moving baseline. We made a correction to revenue based on a region's GDP (“no loss and must keep pace with growth in GDP or can sustain losses comparable to national declines in GDP”). The current and reference years used for unemployment and GDP data were based on the average current year and average reference year across the sector data sources used for number of jobs and revenue, respectively.

**Global 2013:**
Same as Global 2012.

**Brazil:**
Same as Global 2012.

**US West Coast:**
Same as Global 2012.

####Interpreting a score:

A score of 100 would indicate that revenue has not decreased compared to its value five years previous.
