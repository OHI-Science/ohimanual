####Practical Considerations

####*Ideal Approach*

Ideally, data for all habitats within a region would be available, as well as information on the value of the land and the vulnerability of inhabitants being protected by these habitats. This requires data for habitat type at high spatial resolution  as well as a measure of the value of what is protected by the habitats. The reference point for habitat-based goals will likely be a temporal baseline; this means that historic data are needed such that current habitat and value data can be compared to them.

####Recommendations for regional assessments

This goal model aims to assess the amount of protection provided by marine and coastal habitats against flooding and erosion to coastal areas that people value, both inhabited (homes and other structures) and uninhabited (parks, special places, etc.). At local and regional scales data may exist on all these variables at a high enough resolution to map and calculate exactly which habitats are providing how much protection to which coastal areas. In addition, one might want to know the level of vulnerability of the different coastal communities (e.g. ability to evacuate, fragility of constructions, economic ability to reconstruct in case of damage, etc.), so as to prioritize protection of certain locations. Physical properties may be available in regional studies, allowing for more a detailed understanding of the protective ability, and likelihood of exposure for each habitat type in different portions of the coastline.


> In the U.S. West Coast assessment (2014), researchers went to the local public library to find hand-drawn maps of historical sand-dunes in California, for example. No digital data were available in the 19th century.
