### Practical Considerations

####Ideal Approach

This goal model measures the amount of seafood sustainably harvested in a given region for primarily human consumption. It should include quantity of fish caught by any practice including wild-caught commercial fisheries, mariculture, artisanal-scale fisheries and recreational fisheries.

#### Recommendations for your assessment:

The overall Food Provision model should not change: it should always measure whether the seafood from fisheries and mariculture (if it is practiced) is harvested at maximum carrying capacity while remaining sustainable. The contribution of each practice to the overall score is weighted by its relative contribution to the total seafood yield.
So far we have only been able to assess commercial fisheries and mariculture with this model. However, if another component were added, for example artisanal fisheries, one might want to consider different options for how to combine it into the indicator. Is a ton of fish harvested through artisanal fisheries equivalent to a ton harvested commercially? Currently, this is the assumption for the Food Provision. But if there is solid rationale to use a different approach, using a different approach to calculating the goal is within the abilities of the OHI.

<!---Note that turtle eggs, shark fins, etc., are Natural Products rather than food provision. Say that you will have to divide appropriately these two categories across these two goals. Can connect to 'sprat' discussion in FAQ.--->
