#### Practical Considerations

#### Comparing **Biodiversity, Species** and **Iconic Species**

> In the Global Assessments, the **Species** and **Iconic Species** sub-goals are closely related in terms of data sources but are applied differently in the goal models.

#### *Ideal Approach*

Ideally, data would be available on all species that are present in an area, along with spatial representations of their ranges and status assessments for their condition that can be used as a weighting factor. At the same time, a list of species that are important to coastal communities, and then a separate assessments would judge the condition of each of the populations. It would ideally be possible to find a list from a trusted source of the iconic species for an area. Because almost any species can be iconic to someone, defining which species are culturally iconic can be challenging; information can sometimes be found from local customs and experts, oral tradition, anthropological literature, journalism, and other assessments.

### Ready to start on **Species** goals?

You should start by trying to **find information on the species that occur in your area and whether their conservation statuses** have been scientifically assessed. For the **Biodiversity** goal, it is important to note that you can only those species data for which there is assessment scoring information in addition to other range or presence-absence information. For this reason, it has been the preferred method to use the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) *Red List* as a data source for species assessments because of the unbiased way in which the assessments are conducted and because of the global scale. AquaMaps data have also been used in the Global Assessments. However, marine data are not as good for species at the global scale. For regional assessments, more localized studies or marine species databases are best utilized here. You can complement the species list search with a scientific literature search to see if anyone has scored the species status in a way that you can use.

> For example, in the OHI Arctic Assessment, iconic species included bowhead, minke, fin, gray and humpback whales and polar bears. Walruses were not included in the High Seas Assessment because they were determined to be data-deficient by the IUCN.

Once you have the full list of assessed species, you may start to find a subset for the **Iconic Species** sub-goal of **Special Places**. Choosing iconic species is not a fixed process, so you may have to consider unusual approaches. For instance, are there known "indicator species" in your area? Are there species that are culturally held as valuable? Do any species appear on the currency or postage stamps? In practice, **Iconic Species** are usually a subset of the broader list of species in an area, and so you should be able to find **Iconic Species** after having found assessed species data for **Biodiversity** first.

Alternatively, you can figure out which iconic species are present, and then use another kind of assessment approach to see if the populations are healthy, which could be indicated by their stability. The approach you take will depend on the data you find.

> TIP: One creative way to think about **Iconic Species** is to think about what kinds of animals or plants would appear on local stamps. In this case, the choice of species has already been made by a community.

The choice of inclusion of iconic species in your list can be a subjective judgment. You could also come up with specific inclusion criteria, for instance, that would filter a list of species or filter a subset of the gathered data for **Biodiversity**, and then you could use this new list in the **Special Places** goal. This would be a more rigorous approach because then it could be documented and you could replicate the study in future assessments.

#### Map Considerations <!---Check--->

Once you have gathered the data, the treatment of it will matter for the model and goal score calculation. The treatment will be both scientific and philosophical. Do you know how the data were collected? Do you have information on sampling effort? If you don't know, you may not be sure whether changes in condition are due to monitoring efforts or biodiversity change, and you therefore may want to consider the uncertainty of your model.

In any case, the original logic is to represent the species present relative to the proportion of their range within a given EEZ. The goal is to summarize extinction risk for an area across assessessed species, and assign it appropriately so that the loss of species scores poorly. But consider, is this a linear relationship? Will drawing borders affect how your scores are assigned? You may also want to avoid penalizing a region too heavily if only a very small portion of the range comes from a highly threatened species, for example.

When considering how to change the model, think about the outcome of the score on your decisions. For instance, will weighting a "Critically Endangered" species higher on the scale result in the inclusion of more rare species? Will the way you aggregate spatial data to summarize extinction risk for your area take into account the influence of rare species, or will they be lost in the averaging process? An inherent disadvantage of this process is that rare species, which may get rarer in the future, will have a relatively small influence on the score, while common species will drive the results.

<!---Question: is there a helpful example here?--->

Thinking about the reference point is something else to consider. You can use the same threshold as the Global Assessments to say that places with extinction risk scores greater than 75% will get scores of zero, because this is an estimation based on the literature of mass exinctions and could be applied across scales. You donâ€™t need all species extinct for there to be a 0, so you will have to choose how to rescale it, and whether the risk effects are linear or nonlinear.
