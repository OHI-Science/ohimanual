### Discovering Data and Developing Models for Fisheries Goals

>These goals measure the amount of seafood sustainably harvested in your region for human consumption. It should incorporate the quantity of fish caught by the different practices. It should also incorporate how sustainable each practice is. This includes wild-caught commercial fisheries, mariculture, and artisanal-scale fisheries.

You should find as much data as possible on fish caught in your area. You should try to find data for the main types of fisheries, including **Wild-Caught Fisheries** and ocean-based **Mariculture**. If you do not have formal stock assessments for the species in your area, there are ways to develop estimations using data-poor methods. In any case, you should also attempt to find information on the maximum sustainable yield in your area. The goal aims to maximize the amount of sustainably produced seafood from wild or ocean-cultured stocks, and because of that, any seafood harvest using unsustainable fishing practices or catch levels is penalized.

The overall **Food Provsision** model should not change. It should always measure whether seafood from fisheries and mariculture is being harvested at your defined maximum carrying capacity and whether the harvest is remaining sustainable. The contribution of each type of practice to the overall score is weighted by its relative contribution to the total seafood yield in your area.

The Global Assessments have studied both commercial fisheries and mariculture. If you found good catch data for artisanal fisheries, you may want to consider different options for how to use it as an additional component in this goal and combine the sub-goals into a weighted indicator. Does one tonne of fish caught through one component mean more than one tonne of fish caught in the others? If this is the case, you should also think about how to apportion the data correctly.

#### Where to start on **Wild-Caught Fisheries**?

*Ideal Approach*

>The **Wild-Caught Fisheries** sub-goal describes the amount of wild-caught seafood harvested and its sustainability for human consumption.

Ideally, you would find data for catch and effort of every commercial and recreationally-fished species in your area. You would also be able to find the functional relationship between fish population size, or biomass, and its maximum sustainable yeld (BMSY). Then, fisheries catch and effort information would be used to calculate the present biomass against BMSY would be used to set the reference point. The current status would be calculated using the present state of every individual species and combining each species together as the weighted proportion of the total catch.

*Practical Guidance*

The type of modeling you will do will depend on the type of data you find. If your assessment relies on catch data alone, it is highly recommended to reference the Global 2013 approach rather than the 2012 approach (Halpern *et al.* 2012).  The Global 2013 used a fisheries modeling method for data-poor sources following *Martell & Froese* (2013). You can find data for catch-per-unit effort data, and then create a functional relationship to determine the reference point.

> At a global scale, catch, effort, and MSY estimates are not available for either commercial, artisanal or recreational fishing: only landings data for commercial fisheries are available through the United Nations Food and Agriculture program (UN FAO). You should be able to find more localized data.

When collecting data on fish landings, it's important to consider how you will divide the data among regions. You should try to assess each fish species by its entire population across all regions.  The status in the Global 2013 model was calculated based on estimating population biomass relative to the biomass that can deliver maximum sustainable yield for each landed stock (B/BMSY). This ratio is conventionally used to inform fisheries management. This approach adopts the population biomass at MSY (BMSY) as a single-species reference point, which by various assessment frameworks is considered conservative (Frœse *et al*. 2011). If you are in a situation where you are working from port landings data alone, you may have to find out where the boats are registered to fish to estimate locations.

>If you are replicating the Global model, you don't want to split the catch among sub-regions; instead, you want to sum catch across all sub-regions, so you can calculate B/Bmsy for the whole population.

The principle of the reference point should not change. You should be creating models that penalize scores for harvesting above the maximum sustainable yield, as defined in your assessment, and scores that penalize for harvesting below the sustainable yield. The penalties vary in the Global models, where overfished species negatively influence scores more than under-fished species do. It is important to also consider buffering around the reference point because of imperfect knowledge about the data. Part of this depends on the type of assumptions you want to make about the ecology of fish species in your area and the impacts upon them from fishing practices. For instance, when all species are exploited simultaneously, fishing pressure on each population might be lower due to changes in interactions between species that occur when a predator population is reduced.

>The Global Assessments adopt a precautionary estimate of the total amount of sustainably caught seafood by allowing for a 75%-of-BMSY buffer in the score. <!---OAM FIX--->

Since Global 2012, several new data-poor approaches have been developed to assess fisheries that leverage globally-available information (Costello et al., 2012; Martell & Frœse, 2013; Thorson et al., 2013). The catch-MSY approach improves upon the method used in Global 2012 in that it leverages a mechanistic understanding of the connection between harvest dynamics and population dynamics and uses this to infer stock depletion levels as a function of both historical patterns in catch and of species-specific resilience traits (see also Thorson et al. 2013). In addition, this model is more informative in the case of developing fisheries, whereas the previous approach assumed a perfect score in cases where a peak with successive decline had yet to be observed.

> For Global 2012 and Global 2013, the formulae show that a stock receives a score of zero if either it is completely depleted (B/BMSY = 0) or if it is completely under-fished (B/ BMSY = 3.35, with 3.35 representing the local currently observed maximum value). Any past or future B/ BMSY values greater than 3.35, as well as the species with this maximum value, would receive a zero score for food provision to denote that the species is severely under-fished.

This more complex (although still data poor) approach better takes into account species-specific fishery dynamics.  In addition, the scores for each population were combined using a geometric mean, which ensures that smaller, rarer populations have more weight and thus biodiversity of the catch is taken into account as well. The estimates of B/BMSY were obtained by applying a model developed by Martell & Frœse, (2013), and referred to as the “catch-MSY” method. This approach adopts the population biomass at MSY (BMSY) as a single-species reference point, which by various assessment frameworks is considered conservative (e.g., Frœse et al. 2011).

#### Examples of the Approach

Assessment | Developing the Model  | Setting the Reference Point | Other Considerations
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|
**Global 2012** | The status was calculated as a function of the absolute difference between a region’s total landed biomass from the reference multi-species maximum sustainable yield weighted by a correction factor for taxonomies. This was calculated by summing all the single-species MSY estimates obtained for commercially-landed species. | The reference point was based on the difference from multispecies MSY (mMSY), an estimate of the optimum amount of all marine species that may be caught sustainably. The reference point was set so the total landed biomass of wild-caught species will not be more than 75% of the estimated mMSY using and an asymmetrical buffer where overfished stocks achieve a perfect score if B/BMSY is up to 0.2 points below 1 and under-fished stocks achieve a perfect score if B/BMSY is within 0.5 points of 1.  | The approach had to be modified by working with fisheries scientists to adapt the data that were available at the global scale.
**Global 2013** | The status was calculated based on estimating population biomass relative to the biomass that can deliver maximum sustainable yield for each landed stock (B/BMSY) using the catch-MSY model. Single-species values of B/ BMSY were aggregated using a geometric mean. | The reference point was similar to Global 2012 where regions were penalized for under-harvest and more severely for over-harvest. | The catch status was improved in this assessment to capture multi-species effects.The reference point was calculated through a more robust model than the one used in Global 2012, and it is a more direct measure of population health because it relates directly to population size.
**Brazil (2014)** | The status was calculated in the same manner as Global 2012, with a modified sustainability term. | As in Global 2012, the reference point is based on an estimate mMSY. | This was calculated in the same manner as Global 2012 using local-scale data on exploitation category of species caught within Brazil’s EEZ as a catch-based sustainability index.
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | The status was based on B/BMSY for each landed stock and fishing mortality that can deliver maximum sustainable yield (F/FMSY). There were stock assessments for 41 species with historical data available. Estimates were extracted for each species and then assigned to each region based on the contribution of each species in each region to the overall catch in that region, along with weighting factors. |  The reference point was a functional relationship that accounted for fishing pressure. The approach produced lower scores for species where both under-fishing and overfishing are occurring, but did not punish as much for under-fishing of stocks. | This study used formal stock assessments rather than data-poor estimates from catch data. The use of historical information was useful in creating sub-regional scores for this goal. This study also tested the use of a recently published data-poor approach (Costello *et al.* 2012) to obtain B/ BMSY values for the remaining stocks.

#### Where to start on **Mariculture**?

>**Mariculture** measures the ability to reach the highest levels of seafood gained from farm-raised facilities without damaging the ocean's ability to provide fish sustainably now and in the future.

*Ideal Approach*

Ideally, you would find information on the total area available for mariculture. This could be in terms of s physical area or area based on siting priorities. You would also find information on the sustainability of the mariculture practices. This is important because mariculture competes for space with many other ocean uses, including fishing, tourism, and other activities. This approach would not penalize regions that have less geographic area available for mariculture, though places with fewer sheltered bays or lower primary production could be at a disadvantage.

!Higher scores reflect high food provisioning in a sustainable manner, while not compromising the water quality in the farmed area and not relying on wild populations to feed or replenish the cultivated species. A score of 100 means that a region is sustainably harvesting the greatest amount of farmed seafood possible based on its own potential (where its maximum potential is estimated in different ways depending on the assessment).

*Practical Guidance*

This goal requires spatial information. You would have to find maps determining where coastal activities are allowed, or find other kind of data that tells you the usage restrictions for activities in your waters. You would also have to find assessments that have been made to identify the coastal and offshore habitats that are appropriate for each intended type of mariculture species.

The reference point for will depend on your context. You should try to account for the full potential extent of mariculture in your marine areas. This could be based on a number of variables such as the habitat suitability for each cultured species, the distance from the coast, information on which habitat is suitable, and how local preferences favor the allotment of marine space to mariculture versus to ports, hotels, beaches, tourism, or other uses. This definition of space therefore can be physical or social. Keep in mind that in the Global approach, a low score can indicate one of two things – that species are being farmed in an unsustainable manner or that regions are not maximizing the potential to farm in their marine territorial waters.

!--- Setting a spatial reference point in this way assumes that because China is able to produce such a high proportion of mariculture to its coastal area, all regions should be able to as well, given current ecological and technological conditions. This also assumes that it is socially desirable for all regions to produce farmed species at this level, which is likely not true for all regions.Global 2012 compared all areas to that with the highest observed production density after the sustainability coefficient was applied, based on the assumption that all coastal area in each region could be developed for mariculture at the same production density as the reference region (i.e., China) and that maximum potential productivity per unit of area is similar across ecosystems and regions.

> The 2012 Global Assessment included the entire area of the coastline assuming that mariculture could be developed everywhere. This was done because there was not information about social limitations for how much coastal area could be allotted to mariculture.

<!---OAM FIX---> There was a significant change between Global 2012 and Global 2013 to improve the reference point. The coastal population was factored in to the reference point. This shows that you should think about how to improve methods constantly.The reference point approach was to was on harvested tonnes per coastal inhabitant (with coastal defined as within 25 km inland), under the assumption that production depends on the presence of coastal communities that can provide the labor force, infrastructures, and economic demand to support the development and economic viability of mariculture facilities. Thus, two regions with an equal number of coastal inhabitants harvesting an equal tonnage of cultured seafood should score the same, even if one is larger than the other, as the productivity is commensurate to each region’s socio-economic potential to develop mariculture. Stated another way, mariculture development is assumed to scale proportionally with coastal population as a proxy for local demand and potential logistic limitations to farm development, e.g., presence of infrastructures, coastal access, and locally available workforce.

!--- Global 2012 compared all areas to that with the highest observed production density after the sustainability coefficient was applied, based on the assumption that all coastal area in each region could be developed for mariculture at the same production density as the reference region (i.e., China) and that maximum potential productivity per unit of area is similar across ecosystems and regions. This caused regions with extensive proportions of coastline where mariculture is unsuitable for biological reasons (e.g., the water freezes for large part of the year) or logistical reasons (e.g., scarcely inhabited), such as Canada, to be unduly penalized.

#### Examples of the Approach

*Mariculture*

Assessment | Developing the Model  | Setting the Reference Point | Other Considerations
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|
**Global 2012** | Mariculture was calculated as the yield reported multiplied by the sustainability for each species harvested. Yield was drawn from UN FAO reports, and sustainability was based on information from a Mariculture Sustainability Index (MSI) by Trujillo (2008). | The reference point for mariculture was a spatial comparison set at highest amount of seafood produced per square kilometer of eligible coastline in the most productive region observed, China. | Restricting the area based on biophysical constraints and social preferences at a global scale was not possible, and so the entire area within 3nm of the coastline was considered potential habitat.
**Global 2013** | This study used a model similar to the Global 2012. |  The reference point approach was harvested tonnes per coastal inhabitant scaled to the 95th percentile observed, Thailand. Here coastal was defined as "within 25 km inland." This was done under the assumption that production depends on the presence of coastal communities. | This study differs from Global 2012 because of the reference point. |
**Brazil (2014)** | The status was calculated using harvest data reported by the Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA). For each of up to four species cultured within the state, the score was determined by the yield, the reference sustainable production per unit area, and the total potential farming area. |  Reference points were set for each species. | In this study it was possible to use both biophysical constraints and social preferences.
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | The status was calculated as the sustainable production density of shellfish biomass from mariculture relative to a target level of production density for each state within the region. | The reference point was a target level of production increase as proposed by NOAA | The approach was similar to the Global but the reference point was made using better information about physical and social limitations on mariculture allotments.

#### Where to start on **Artisanal Opportunities**?

*Ideal Approach*

Ideally, this goal would include some measure of how easy or hard it is for fishermen to access ocean resources when they need them and a quantified evaluation of the sustainability of harvest of all nearshore stocks used by artisanal fishers. The type of reference point you use will depend on the data available.

*Practical Guidance*

You should include data that are distinct from the catch data used in other areas of **Food Provision**. So once you find catch data and access data, you should think about which goals to use it in. For instance, if you find tonnage of artisanally-caught fish, you should include that elsewhere. In any case, you will likely modify the default Global Assessment model using different and better-resolved data.

>For example, in the Baltic Sea region, **Artisanal Opportunities** is very closely connected to **Tourism and Recreation** since there are a lot of locals and tourists using the shared sea for enjoyment. You will have to decide how to apportion the data.

Here, you will want to find proxy data for *access* in whatever way best suits your areas. This could be drawn from physical, economic, regulatory, or stock condition data as an indication of availability. A combination of all of these would be best to more accurately speak to the philosophy, but is is usually limited by data.s

> For example, in the U.S. West Coast Assessment (2014), three metrics were used to define **Artisanal Opportunity** that you can use to study:

| Type of Access | Data Used | Reference Point |
|-----|------|-------|
| Physical | Number of coastal access points per mile | 1 coastal access point per mile |
| Economic | Change in gas price over time | No change in gas price |
| Resource | Condition of fish stocks through NOAA Fish Stock Index | Perfect sustainability score on FSI |

The **reference point for this goal** would likely be a metric of having full access to the resource. Keep in mind that the access is for people, and therefore a marine protected area may not count towards full access.

ORPHAN
global 2012
The need for artisanal fishing could potentially be driven by any number of socio-economic factors, but the most wide-spread reason is the need for food either directly or through undocumented local trade which correlates well with poverty level. Data on how many people live below the poverty level are not available for many regions. Therefore, we used an analogous proxy that is more complete globally: per capita gross domestic product (pcGDP) adjusted by the purchasing power parity (PPP).

The sustainability of artisanal fishing practices could be approximated by using the status of the species that are targeted by artisanal fishermen. Unfortunately data on harvest from artisanal fisheries are often unavailable so we were unable to include this term in the calculation of this goal; we include it here for conceptual completeness.

A score of 100 means that a region is addressing and meeting the needs that people and communities have to fish artisanally by implementing government policies that permit or encourage them to do so, providing appropriate access to near-shore areas, and maintaining the species targeted in good health.

. There are no data available on the number of people actively participating in artisanal fishing activities, nor a good approximation of what a reasonable reference condition would be that would allow to model ‘demand’ for artisanal fishing opportunities were these data available.

#### Examples of the Approach

Assessment | Developing the Model  | Setting the Reference Point | Other Considerations
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|
**Global 2012** | The status was the demand as estimated by poverty levels. The data were measured by the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, adjusted by the purchasing power parity as a proxy for undocumented trade. The supply was estimated using an indicator that ranked how well regions regulated and supported artisanal fishing, as part of a study by Mora *et al.* (2009). | The reference point was having supply greater than demand so that unmet demand is 0. This meant that all demand for artisanal fishing was allowed or achieved. | The trend was driven by the change over time in PPPpcGDP as a proxy for demand. This assessment did not incorporate a specific measure of the health of the targeted species or of sustainability of practices.
**Global 2013** | The approach was the same was Global 2012 | The reference point was the same as Global 2012. | There were no data updates available to change the method.
**Brazil (2014)** | The model was simplified to reflect the primary driver of opportunity as the availability of fish to be captured, as measured by the condition of stocks. This model was based solely on the sustainability index calculated using the exploitation status of species. All species were considered possible targets of artisanal fishing activities. | The reference point for artisanal fishing opportunities was an established target of 1.0. This meant all stocks are categorized as either Developing or Fully Exploited. | The analysis used national stock status information. It did not include poverty because of the high variation in the country. In addition, it assumes that access to fishing is largely open because permitting and regulations are not restricted.
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | This study developed a model using three key variables of physical and economic access to coastal areas, and access to biological resources. The physical accesses was shore-based fishing measured by percent of coastline within a mile coastal access points. Economic access was no increase in fuel price compared to income. Biological access was the health of the fish stocks.. | The target here is to maximize the amount of public access along the coast, therefore a perfect score results when each part of a region’s coastline has a coastal access point within 1 mile. The study calculated these scores using a raster map allocation. | This approach did not model demand or have species-specific information. It assumed that as long as there are no obstacles to pursuing artisanal fishing, the goal was fully achieved. These data better capture the nature of small-scale fisheries in the study area than the Global model.
