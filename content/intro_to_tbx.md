## The Ocean Health Index Toolbox

**The OHI Toolbox** is an ecosystem of data, scripts, and structure used to facilitate groups with the highly collaborative OHI assessment process at any scale. Toolbox scripts are open source, written in the software language R, and data inputted into the Toolbox are *.csv* (comma-separated-value) files, which can be created or edited using text editors or Microsoft Excel.  

The Toolbox ecosystem is organized through an online collaborative platform, called **GitHub**. GitHub stores the R scripts and *.csv* files in a folder called a repository, which is found online and can also be downloaded on your computer and synced with the online version. GitHub tracks changes by all collaborators working on the project through time, and saves all versions for comparison.  

The Toolbox is used to calculate final scores. But, perhaps more importantly, it can also be used to organize an assessment, including data identification and management.  The Toolbox can additionally be used to compare how different management scenarios could affect overall ocean health, which can inform effective strategies for ocean resource management at a local scale.
