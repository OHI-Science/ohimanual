<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> What is OHI+?</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Your assessment will be an example of independent Ocean Health Index+ assessment (OHI+). At this stage of the process, you should have <strong>Learned</strong> and <strong>Planned</strong> for the assessment, and are now ready to <strong>Conduct</strong> it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Ocean Health Index framework presents a highly tailorable approach ready to meet the needs and priorities of those who wish to use the ocean sustainably. Here you will learn how to conduct an Ocean Health Index+ (OHI+) assessment. The OHI+ approach adds new inputs and information to the overarching OHI framework that consist of data and indicators that are relevant to the local context. Because method of the framework is repeatable, transparent, quantitative, and goal-driven, repeated assessments are invaluable because they can be used to tack and monitor the progress of ocean health through time. Even a first-effort OHI+ is valuable because it establishes a baseline against which to monitor change. Such a flexible framework allows OHI+ assessments to adapt to local conditions while still being useful for management.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember that when conducting an assessment, the process is just as valuable as the results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Index is the first assessment tool that provides a common platform for scientifically combining and comparing key elements from all dimensions of the oceans health — biological, physical, economic, and social – to measure how sustainably people are using the ocean. By allowing for a comprehensive and integrated view of marine systems as a way to understand the trade-offs and synergies among these goals, the Index represents a significant advance over conventional single-sector approaches to assessing sustainability as communicated through other kinds of index efforts. Because of this, preparing the conducting phase will require careful thought, consideration, and documentation, throughout this scientific process.</p>
<div id="the-process-of-ohi-phase-three" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.0.1</span> The Process of OHI+: Phase Three</h3>
<p>The OHI+ process consists of four distinct phases. In the first phase, you <strong>learned</strong> about the OHI and understood the philosophy behind it and the motivation for conducting your study. In the second phase, you actively <strong>planned</strong> to conduct an OHI+ Assessment. Now, in the third phase, you will <strong>conduct</strong> the assessment by engaging with the science of finding the data, preparing the goal models, and taking the necessary steps to learn the software and produce the results. In the final phase, you will communicate the results of your OHI+ Assessment in order to inform stakeholders who will use its findings.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.0.1.1</span> What to expect when conducting an assessment</h4>
<!---From Conducting_assessment--->
<p>There are key considerations and processes that will be a part of every assessment, however, the process for conducting each assessment will be unique depending on the local context. For example: what data and indicators are available will determine how goal models can be tailored to the region, and what skillsets and resources are involved will affect the time it takes to complete the assessment.</p>
</div>
<div id="where-to-start-when-conducting-an-assessment" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.0.1.2</span> Where to start when conducting an assessment</h4>
<p>You should start by understanding the structure of the global assessment and the data involved will help you think about what should be done differently in your local context.</p>
<p>The best way to do this is to begin with the WebApps. As described in the section, “<strong>Overview of the OHI WebApp</strong>,” most coastal countries have a WebApp that was created to facilitate planning and communication during your assessment. The WebApp presents data, goal models and calculated scores for each region (global administrative area identified by <a href="http://gadm.org" class="uri">http://gadm.org</a>) visually through maps, histograms, and tables. All data presented were extracted from the global analysis, and scores were calculated using global goal models. For a finer-scale assessment of ocean health in your region, these data files provided will need to be updated with available data and indicators for each region in your assessment. However, if better data are not available, you can use the data provided. Then, to dive deeper into data layers and goal models, you can explore your assessment’s GitHub repository, which stores all the information presented through the WebApp.</p>
<p>You should also be familiar with the approaches taken by other assessments adapted from the global context, including Brazil, the US West Coast, and Fiji. You can find these studies at <a href="http://ohi-science.org" class="uri">http://ohi-science.org</a>.</p>
<p>While our team of scientists and managers is prepared to provide guidance for assessments, you should follow the steps in this training program to complete your assessment as autonomously as possible.</p>

<div id="expected-outcomes" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.0.2</span> Expected outcomes</h3>
<p><strong>The process of conducting an OHI assessment is as valuable as the final results.</strong> This is because while conducting an OHI assessment you will identify gaps in knowledge and data, produce decision-relevant information, and create an ocean alliance that combines knowledge and cultural values across disciplines. Conducting an OHI assessment requires engagement from as many different groups as possible, including research institutions, government agencies, policy groups, non-governmental organizations, and the civil and private sectors.</p>
<p><strong>Finding the best data and indicators available is crucial for obtaining meaningful findings that can help inform decision-making.</strong> Assessments can incorporate higher-resolution data and indicators, local priorities and preferences, and develop tailored goal models and reference points, which produce scores that better reflect local realities. If a goal is not relevant in the local context, it can be excluded entirely. When you change goal models, though, it is important to capture the process in order to justify decisions that will inform the results. Similarly, pressures and resilience measures can be refined using local data and indicators. Index scores are only as good as the data on which they are based.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Section Summary:</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This section provides an overview of conducting an OHI assessment. In each assessment, goals are scored from 0 to 100 and then aggregated to produce an overall Index score. An assessment requires data, indicators, and priorities that are appropriate for each context.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>TIP: The process of conducting an OHI assessment is as valuable as the results for policy and management decisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assessments using the OHI framework can be most relevant to policy and management decisions when they are conducted at smaller spatial scales. These spatial scales can include political subdivisions like countries, states, provinces, and eco-regions such as bays. Using ten criteria (called goals), the Index scores on a scale of 0 to 100 how well coastal regions optimize their potential ocean benefits and services in a sustainable way relative to self-established reference points (targets). Relevant goal models are developed based on the best available information, which can be either raw data or composite data, or previously developed indicators.<br /><!---Moving the below to What is OHI+?---> <strong>The process of conducting an OHI assessment is as valuable as the final results.</strong> This is because while conducting an OHI assessment you will identify gaps in knowledge and data, produce decision-relevant information, and create an ocean alliance that combines knowledge and cultural values across disciplines.

![Scores for Ecuador (ECU) as displayed in a flower chart on the the OHI WebApp. The length of a petal indicates the score for the goal or sub-goal, and the width of the petal indicates the goal or sub-goal weighting.](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1kj11Y0lYC0t2ofKD4fDkVUxopws7pIMpxtVD5JyDhAk/pub?w=960&h=720)

Scores can then be visualized to communicate the results to  stakeholders. For example, the **flower plot** shown in the figure demonstrates a useful way to represent OHI scores. Goal or sub-goal scores are shown around the outside of the plot. The length of each 'petal'   represents the goal score, while the width of each petal represents the relative weighting of the goal or sub-goal. Sub-goals are weighted equally by default, as shown here, but can change depending on the regional context.

Clear communication and transparency of the process are fundamental to the Ocean Health Index overall.--->

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>allow for exploration of how the Index works: what data look like and which data layers are used in each goal</li>
<li>are a communication platform for an assessment team, since information is presented in a manner that is accessible to group members of different disciplines and technical capacities</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Background</h2>
<p><strong>OHI WebApps</strong> are websites created to facilitate independent assessments, and one is available for nearly every coastal nation or territory. The WebApps are meant to be a ‘Starter Kit’ and are available through <a href="http://ohi-science.org" class="uri">http://ohi-science.org</a> using a three-letter identifier in the URL. For example, Ecuador’s WebApp (“ECU”) is found at <a href="http://ohi-science.org/ecu" class="uri">http://ohi-science.org/ecu</a>. Each WebApp displays data layers*, which are raw data in this case, as well as the calculated OHI scores based on information extracted from global assessments. As such, they do not provide fine-scale resolution of data for each coastal nation or territory: the scores and data on which they are based are a starting point for an assessment to be conducted by an independent group. These data can be used as a default if better data for the region do not exist, but we encourage you to replace them wherever possible. (*Note: each data component that is included in the OHI is called a <strong>data layer</strong> because it will be combined with others to calculate the goal scores. Many data layers are rescaled from 0-1 to be combined with other data layers on the same unitless scale.)<br />Boundaries for exclusive economic zones (EEZs) were identified by <a href="http://www.marineregions.org" class="uri">http://www.marineregions.org</a> and the largest subcountry regions (i.e., provinces, states, districts) were identified by <a href="http://gadm.org" class="uri">http://gadm.org</a>. Subcountry region boundaries were extended offshore to divide the EEZ of each study area into offshore regions. These subcountry regions have been provided as a starting point, and are typically coastal states or provinces, which, in our experience, is consistent with the scale at which most policy decisions are made. However, it is possible to change the boundaries for the regions and the study area depending on your preferences.</p>

<p>Note that the OHI+ team doesn’t take a stance on disputed territories. For independent assessments, we defer to the map-providers and the best judgment of the technical team.</p>

<p>The information displayed on the website is stored online, in a <strong>GitHub repository.</strong> GitHub is an open-source development platform allows for multiple users to collaborate, track changes, and document work such as data files and code. Therefore, any changes made to the files contained within the GitHub repository will be displayed on the WebApp for all team members to view. (See the section on <strong>GitHub</strong> for how to modify files using that platform).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Using the WebApp</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>When your team has finalized data layers and updated goal models, these data and scores will be visualized through the WebApp.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When first exploring a WebApp (for example, <a href="http://ohi-science.org/ecu" class="uri">http://ohi-science.org/ecu</a>), first note that it is possible to <strong>translate</strong> the site into any language that Google provides using the pull-down menu at the top.<br /><img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/11Gojqw0Xz4kUo_uM1Y699EKO3qN_dae0w93ICzXJ2Pg/pub?w=960&amp;h=720" alt="The WebApp start page. Note that it’s possible to translate the page into your language of choice." /></p>
<p>The WebApp homepage provides several tabs for you to explore. The interactive <strong>App</strong> sub-page allows you to explore input data layers and output calculated scores for each region (See <strong>Overview of Variable Options</strong>). More detailed information is about the default <strong>regions</strong> and <strong>data layers</strong>, <strong>goal models</strong>, and <strong>calculated scores</strong> based on global data can be viewed in separate tabs, as well as through the App page. A quick reference about navigating the WebApp is available through the <strong>Docs</strong> link at the bottom of the page.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-app-page" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> The App Page</h2>
<p>The App page allows you to explore and visualize input data layers and calculated output scores for each region in the study area. By default, global data are presented for each subcountry region in the study area, and scores are calculated for each region using those data.</p>
<p>The App page displays this information through two tabs: Data and Compare. The <strong>Data</strong> tab provides several subtabs for viewing data (<em>Map</em>, <em>Histogram</em>, <em>Table</em>), and is the default tab when the Toolbox is launched. The <strong>Compare</strong> tab is most useful for comparing output scores when modifications are made to the underlying data or models (this provides a way to error check) once you have begun the process of calculating your own assessment.</p>
<p>The App provides two Branch/Scenario options to view, identified in the upper-left corner of the Data tab. The <strong>Branch</strong> options refer to the versions of the GitHub repository where data are stored. Branches start off as copies of the same repository, but can be modified independently of each other, enabling progress to be made on one (‘draft’ branch) while not altering the vetted original (‘published’ branch). These branches can be merged back together at any time. The App page will display the ‘published branch’ by default; we recommend working on the ‘draft’ branch until your assessment is finalized, at which point you would merge the draft branch with the published branch.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario</strong> folders contain all the files needed to calculate scores. Scenario folders can differ from each other based on the years included (i.e., 2014 would be a different scenario from 2015), or they can be used to explore outcomes of policy alternatives, such as implementation of a proposed Marine Protected Area network or fisheries regulations. Running these different scenarios can be very useful for an OHI+ assessment in which multiple outcomes are to be evaluated.</p>

</div>
<div id="discovering-and-gathering-appropriate-data-and-indicators" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Discovering and Gathering Appropriate Data and Indicators</h2>
<p>The OHI spans disciplines and integrates diverse data to give a comprehensive assessment of ocean health. A hallmark of the OHI is that it uses freely-available, existing data and indicators to create models that capture the philosophy of individual goals, and finding appropriate data requires good problem-solving abilities. There are many decisions to make when gathering from disparate sources, identifying good proxies and indicators, deciding reference points, and developing goal models.</p>
<p>** The accuracy of Index scores is a reflection of input data quality and the degree of understanding of the study area, and thus including the best quality and appropriate data and indicators available is of highest importance.**</p>
<p>Because the data and indicators you use will come from different sources and available from online databases, reports, spreadsheets and text files, they will also have different formatting. To include these data and indicators in your assessment, you will need to process these files into the format required by the Toolbox, which is explained in the section, <strong>Formatting Data for the Toolbox</strong>. When data have been prepared and formatted for the Toolbox, we call it a <strong>data layer.</strong> Because creating data layers can be quite time-intensive, data should only be prepared for the Toolbox after final decisions have been made to include the data or indicator in your assessment, and after the appropriate goal model and reference points have been finalized.</p>
<p>There are many data layers included in the OHI framework. There are about eighty individual data layers from the global assessment that should be replaced with higher-resolution data in your study area where possible. You will need to search for data used to calculate status models as well as pressures and resilience layers.</p>
<div id="data-sources" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.6.1</span> Data sources</h3>
<p>Existing data and indicators can be gathered from many sources across environmental, social, and economic disciplines, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>government reports and project websites</li>
<li>peer-reviewed literature</li>
<li>masters and PhD theses</li>
<li>university websites</li>
<li>non-profit organizations</li>
</ul>
<p>All data must be rescaled to specific reference points (targets) before being combined with the Toolbox; therefore setting these reference points at the appropriate scale is a fundamental component of any OHI assessment. This requires your assessment team to interpret the philosophy of each Index goal and sub-goal using the best available data and indicators. Some indicators already are scaled (e.g., from 0-1 or 0-10), and can easily be incorporated into your assessment since the reference points have already been identified.</p>
</div>
<div id="gathering-responsibilities" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.6.2</span> Gathering responsibilities</h3>
<p>Gathering appropriate data requires searching for and accessing existing data. You do not have to go collect the data itself, but you do need to discover and acquire existing data. It is important that team members responsible for data discovery make thoughtful decisions about whether data are appropriate for the assessment, and that they get feedback from the full team to discuss the merits of different data sources. Data discovery and acquisition are typically an iterative process, as there are both practical and philosophical reasons for including or excluding data.</p>
<p>When you begin exploring data possibilities, you can seek local data sources that could directly replace data from the global assessment provided in your repository. Such data would be better quality, i.e., higher accuracy and spatio-temporal resolution, than the data from the global assessment, and models may not need to change. However, we recommend first exploring other data possibilities that could capture specific characteristics to your study area. Assessments conducted at smaller scales are an opportunity to include characteristics specific to your study area that were not captured in the global assessment.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-process-of-discovery" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.6.3</span> The process of discovery</h3>
<p>The most important thing to remember when gathering data and indicators is that they must contribute to measuring ocean health. Not all information that enhances our knowledge of marine processes directly convey information about ocean health and may not be appropriate within the OHI framework. Because of this, compiled indicators can sometimes be more suitable than raw data measuring single marine attributes.</p>
<p>Begin by understanding and comparing the best approaches used in assessments that have been completed, including global assessments, Brazil, Fiji, and the US West Coast. For the smaller-scale assessments (i.e., anything but the global assessments), if finer-resolution local data were available in the study area, these data were either incorporated into modified goal models that used locally appropriate and informed approaches or into the existing global goal model. When local data were not available, the global-scale data and global goal models were used, which is least desirable because it does not provide more information than the global study. When looking for data, the following decision tree may be useful. This should be a goal-by-goal process:</p>

<div id="requirements-for-data-and-indicators" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.6.4</span> Requirements for data and indicators</h3>
<p>There are six requirements to remember when investigating (or ‘scoping’) potential data and indicators. It is important that data satisfy as many of these requirements as possible, at times requiring gap-filling solutions. If requirements are not met and gap-filling solutions are not possible, you will likely need to exclude a dataset from the analyses. If data cannot be included, you may elect to use the global data layers or identify other data and a different modeling approach.</p>

</ol>
<div id="relevance-to-ocean-health" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.6.4.1</span> Relevance to ocean health</h4>
<p>There must be a clear connection between the data and ocean health, and determining this will be closely linked to each goal model.</p>
</div>
<div id="accessibility" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.6.4.2</span> Accessibility</h4>
<p>The two main points regarding accessibility are whether the source is open access and whether the data or indicators will be updated regularly.</p>
<p>The Index was created in the spirit of transparency and open-access, using open-source software and online platforms such as GitHub, is to ensure as much accessibility and open collaboration as possible. Data and indicators included should also follow these guidelines, so that anyone wishing to understand more about the Index may be able to see what data were used and how. For this reason we emphasize the importance of using data that may be made freely downloadable, as well as the importance of clearly documenting all data sources and reasons for the choices made in selecting data, indicators, and models.</p>
<p>Index scores can be recalculated annually as new data become available. This can establish a baseline of ocean health and serve as a monitoring mechanism to evaluate the effectiveness of actions and policies in improving the status of overall ocean health. This is good to keep in mind while looking for data: will it be available again in the future? It is also important to document the sources of all data so that it is both transparent where it came from and you will be able to find it in the future.</p>
</div>
<div id="quality" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.6.4.3</span> Quality</h4>
<p>Understanding how the data or indicators were collected or created is important. Are they collected by a respected organization with quality control? Are there any protocol changes to be aware of, e.g., were there changes in the collection protocol to be aware of when interpreting temporal trends?</p>
</div>
<div id="reference-point" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.6.4.4</span> Reference point</h4>
<p>Most data will need to be scaled to a reference point, as you consider different data sources it is important to think about or identify what a reasonable reference point may be. Ask the following types of questions as you explore data possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has past research identified potential targets for these data?</li>
<li>example: maximum sustainable yield in fisheries</li>
<li>Have policy targets been set regarding these data?</li>
<li>example: maximum levels of pollutants before beach closures</li>
<li>Would a historic reference point be an appropriate target?</li>
<li>example: percent of habitat coverage before coastal development</li>
<li>Could a region within the study area be set as a spatial reference point?</li>
<li>example: a certain region a leader in creating protected areas</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="appropriate-spatial-scale" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.6.4.5</span> Appropriate spatial scale</h4>
<p>Data must be available for every region within the study area.*</p>
</div>
<div id="appropriate-temporal-scale" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.6.4.6</span> Appropriate temporal scale</h4>
<p>Data must be available for at least three to five years to calculate the trend. For some goals, where temporal reference points are desirable, longer time series are preferable.*</p>
<p>* It is not always possible to fully meet the spatial and temporal requirements with each source. In these cases, provided that the gaps are not extensive, it can still be possible to use these data if appropriate gap-filling techniques are used (See: ‘Formatting Data for Toolbox’ section).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="example-us-west-coast-data-discovery" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.6.5</span> Example: US West Coast data discovery</h3>
<p>Below are examples of some decisions made when exploring available data for the US West Coast assessment. Determining whether certain data could be included began with a solid understanding of the data layers and models included in the global assessment. Since the US West Coast is a data-rich region, finer-resolution local data could be used in place of many of the global data layers. The US West Coast assessment had five regions: Washington, Oregon, Northern California, Central California, and Southern California.</p>
<div id="reasons-data-were-excluded" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.6.5.1</span> Reasons data were excluded</h4>
<p>There are a lot of existing data that contribute to our scientific understanding of ocean processes and interactions but are not ideal for the OHI. Reasons to exclude data are both due to practical requirements (e.g., resolution, coverage, or other requirements that have been listed) and philosophical requirements (i.e., they do not help capture the attributes of interest for assessing ocean health). Some common reasons for excluding data are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The data do not cover the entire area of the reporting region</strong>. The state of California had excellent, long-term data on public attendance at state parks that would have been quite useful in the calculation of the tourism and recreation goal. However, data were only available for three of the five regions (the three California regions but not Oregon and Washington), so they could not be used.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>There is not a clear and scientifically observed relationship between the data and ocean health</strong>. Along the US West Coast, kelp beds are a very important habitat because of their contribution to biodiversity and coastal protection. However, kelp coverage variation and is driven primarily by abiotic natural forcing (wave/storm disturbance and temperature) and thus it is not a good indicator of kelp forest health, particularly in the case of anthropogenic impacts. For these reasons kelp coverage was not included in the assessment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The feature being measured may provide benefits to people, but this feature is not derived from marine or coastal ecosystems</strong>. Sea walls and riprap provide coastal protection to many people along the US West Coast. However, these structures are not a benefit that is derived from the marine ecosystems, so only coastal habitats were included in the calculation of this goal. These data can be included as a pressure due to habitat loss. They were not used as a resilience measure because they can often have negative side effects (e.g., by altering sedimentation dynamics), and because they have limited long-term sustainability (i.e., they need maintenance).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data collection is biased and might misrepresent ocean health</strong>. The US Endangered Species Act identifies a species list focused on species of concern within the US. As such, these data are biased in the context of ocean health since they only assess species whose populations may be in danger. For the calculation of the biodiversity goal, using these data would be inappropriate because this goal represents the status of all species in the region, not just those that are currently of conservation concern. Using these data may have shown the status of biodiversity to be lower than it really is because the selection of species to assess was already biased towards species of concern.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Time series data are not long enough to calculate a trend or a reference point</strong> (when a historical reference point is most appropriate). For the US West Coast, the current extent of seagrass habitats was available, however, these do not exist for previous points in time in most areas, so could not be used to calculate the trend or set a historical reference point. Therefore, we estimated the trend in health of seagrass habitats using as a proxy the trend in the main stressor (i.e., turbidity). In other words, we assumed that the rate of seagrass loss was directly proportional to the rate of increase in turbidity. Similar solutions may be used to estimate trends in your own assessment, if there is scientific support for assuming that the trend of what we want to assess (or the relationship between the current state and the state in the reference year) has a strong relationship with the trend of the proxy data available.</p></li>

<p>Data included to calculate scores are partly based on the philosophical framework of the Ocean Health Index (see Part I), and partly based on data available. Several goals that combine across categories have many potential data sources that could be included (or excluded): in particular the natural products, livelihoods and economies, and habitat based goals. The existence of the data itself will drive a lot of these decisions, but here are some guidelines to help determine if data are appropriate philosophically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do the data represent something truly ocean-based, and natural (i.e. not man-made)?</li>
<li>How would the reference point be calculated?</li>
<li>Do data cover the appropriate spatial scales?</li>
<li>Do data cover the appropriate temporal scales?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="which-data-are-available" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.7.2.2</span> Which data are available?</h4>
<p>Humans interact with and depend upon the oceans in complex ways, some of which are familiar and easy to measure, such as providing seafood, transporting goods, or disposing of waste. Other benefits are more difficult to measure, such as the way marine-related jobs indirectly affect coastal communities, how different habitats mediate storm damage or the benefits people receive or perceive simply from living near the ocean. Thinking creatively and exploring the data available can make the Index more representative of reality.</p>
<p>It is important to think creatively and beyond the interests of a specific institution or primary field of study. Google or other internet search engines are great starting places: investigate what kinds of information are available from government and public records, scientific literature, academic studies, surveys and reports or other sources.</p>
<p>Data used in the Ocean Health Index spans a wide array of disciplines, both within and outside of oceanography and marine ecology. Therefore, it is necessary to look beyond the most known or obvious data sources to find data relevant for the goals in the region. Discussions with colleagues, literature searches, emails to experts, and search engines are good ways to understand what kinds of data are collected and to hunt for appropriate data.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-scale-is-appropriate" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.7.2.3</span> What scale is appropriate?</h4>
<p>Here it is important to think about why is there interest in completing an OHI assessment. If managers or policy makers are interested, at what scale do they work? Where are the political boundaries? These questions are important to keep the OHI assessment relevant, but ultimately data availability will be most important in how to define regional boundaries for the OHI.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="whats-important-spatially" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.7.3</span> What’s important spatially?</h3>
<p>There are several spatial considerations you should have prepared before moving forward with the Toolbox. One is your map definitions for use in the assessment and in the WebApps. You must define your map regions and boundary. This can be politically drawn or, if appropriate, biogeographically drawn. Biographic considerations may be important when there are disputed territories or boundary lines in your area. <em>Note that OHI+ does not take a position on disputed territories, so it is up to you to vet the quality of the maps.</em></p>
<p>Once you have the maps, you may also need to define buffer zones. Buffers are distances from shore, both inland and offland, that can be used later in the Toolbox to assess many impacts more accurately.</p>
<p>Finally, you will need to prepare your layers folder with spatial data. Only goals certain goals will require data layers that are spatial (see Section, <strong>Habitat-based goals, practical</strong>*). When considering spatial data, you should be conscientious of how it is presented: is it by square kilometers, or by a kind of region such as an EEZ or other identifier? Do you have better local data than global satellite or modeled data? Once you find the data, consider how far back in time it goes. Can you set a reference point with this data, or do you have to find another dataset or other source of information to find a historical reference point?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TIP: The only thing to do is remember that you are trying to capture ocean health–too far inland may no longer relate to ocean health.</p>
</blockquote>
<!---FIX: Does 1km land buffer make sense in this context? Should they extend this beyond maybe ~5km or more? It just depends on how Ecuadorians define ‘coastal’. Maybe 1km is too much? Maybe not enough? How do people interact with the ocean from onland? Maybe it’s only if you can see the water. Or maybe more. Maybe they could look at cultural sites on land that have been considered coastal and see how many km inland they are. Maybe they should clip as far inland as mangroves go, if these are special places. The only thing to do is remember that you are trying to capture ocean health: too far inland may no longer relate to ocean health. So maybe the idea of a constant buffer is a bad one, and follow the mangrove or saltmarsh lines, combined with other specific special places. But they can also just leave it and not worry about it. Might not be worth bringing up the debate now.
some history: the 1km buffer was used at the global scale because there was spatial data of parks on land, and we needed to exclude ones that didn’t make sense. but since they have a better knowledge of their coastlines and what’s important, they could ditch the buffers and just pick the ones that they know are important coastally.--->

<p>You should do the habitat-based goals together.

<p>Habitat-based goals can be approached together in the data gathering process. Habitats appear in such goals as <strong>Carbon Storage</strong>, <strong>Coastal Protection</strong>, and <strong>Biodiversity</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="ideal-approach" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.7.5.2</span> <em>Ideal Approach</em></h4>
<p>Ideally, information on the extent and condition of every single habitat type would be available. The reference point for habitat-based goals will likely be temporal. This means that historic data are needed such that current habitat and value data can be compared to historic data. This could also be achieved by using or a proportion of historic data.</p>
</div>
<div id="ready-to-start-on-habitat-based-goals" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.7.5.3</span> Ready to start on <strong>Habitat-based Goals</strong>?</h4>
<p>The first thing to consider with habitats is <strong>what habitats are in your area</strong>? You must consider what habitats are in your coastal regions. Are there mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass beds, salt marshes, sea ice, or subtidal soft-bottom habitats? Are there kelp forests in your area?</p>
<p>Once you determine what habitats are in your area, you should also consider whether and to what extent they go offshore and inland. You will likely use a combination of clipped spatial data and spatial data for whole regions, depending on the goal being assessed. For instance, the <strong>Habitat</strong> sub-goal of <strong>Biodiversity</strong> uses the entire region for habitats such as coral reefs in the calculation, but the <strong>Coastal Protection</strong> only uses the extent to 1 kilometer offshore and inland to 1 kilometer <!---Check---> This will affect the preparation of the spatial data layers later in you assessment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For instance, do mangroves occur in river deltas in your area, and if so, how far upriver do they go? In the 2013 Global Assessment, for example, mangrove was assessed from 1 kilometer offshore to 1 kilometer inland, but this distance is variable and could change for you OHI+ assessments. It depends on your geography.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several factors for habitats will have to be considered. In score calculations, habitats are weighted in different ways based on the amount of protection they provide and the amount carbon they sequester, and they are also derived from estimations of habitat health and condition (See <strong>Carbon Storage</strong>, <strong>Coastal Protection</strong>, and <strong>Biodiversity</strong>). The weights on the habitats comes from the literature. If you have access to regional-specific studies, you should use that information. Otherwise, the Global data layers can be used as a secondary option.</p>
<p>When thinking about condition, for instance, coral health is based on the percentage of “living cover” on a reef relative to the potential range of the reef.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Global Assessment, coral reference points used the mean predicted values for a country from 1985-1987. When this data was not available for a country, we used the value of neighboring countries. There was also some analyses to control for the fact that the % live coral cover naturally varies over time, hence the use of “predicted values”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the 2012 Global Assessment, soft-bottom habitat had an estimated status based on the “intensity of trawl fishing” as a proxy (pages 51 and 52 of SOM 2012).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is also important to think about the temporal aspect of your habitats. This will affect the <strong>trend</strong> and the choice of the <strong>reference point</strong>. Trend is the change in health or condition over time. However, this might be constrained by data availability due to the heterogeneity of habitat types and data sources. Ideally, there will be enough years of data to directly calculate the recent change in health of the habitat by using a linear model to calculate trend. This isn’t always the case, and proxies or estimates might need to be used. For example, due to spotty salt marsh data we created trend categories of increasing (0.5), stable (0), and decreasing (-0.5) based on available data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, for sea ice in the Global Assessment, a linear model was set to a metric of sea ice cover for data from 2006-2011, after some smoothing to account for natural variation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall, the historical <strong>reference point</strong> is particularly important for the habitat goals. What’s the ideal reference point, however? You could consider setting the reference point further back in history if you have the data for it. This would assume there was a more pristine condition in the past, and would be based on the assumption that habitat destruction has been and still is occuring. Here it is useful to use the S.M.A.R.T. principles (See <strong>Conceptual Guide</strong>). It is highly encouraged to set an ambitious reference point, and deviate from those which were set in the Global.</p>

<div id="ideal-approach-1" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.7.6.1</span> Ideal Approach</h4>
<p>Ideally, information would be available to allow you to to assess the amount of carbon stored in every coastal habitat in your area. The best information would show area covered and some measure of the quality of the habitat for this goal. For example, a dense mangrove forest would be better quality than a sparse mangrove forest. Additionally, different weights would be assigned to the habitats based on their relative ability to store carbon, and this factor could be used to penalize areas where there is greater loss of carbon and reward areas where this is a greater storage of carbon. The carbon storage model could then incorporate such weights in a similar way to the <strong>Coastal Protection</strong> goal. The reference point for habitat-based goals will likely be temporal in most cases. This means that historic data are needed so that current habitat values can be compared to a past state.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TIP: Understanding habitat carbon storage rates is an area of ongoing research. The capacity for habitats to store carbon varies, and depends on the morphology of plants in the system.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="practical-approach" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.7.6.2</span> Practical Approach</h4>
<p>The model and approach for <strong>Carbon Storage</strong> developed for the Global assessment will likely be appropriate for independent assessments. Knowing the area and the condition of of carbon-storing habitats are the two components that are most important. It is important to spend time looking for a way to quantify condition, but it may not be possible to find.</p>
<p>One of the first decisions for your team to make is <strong>whether to use the given data</strong> in the Global Assessments or <strong>to find and use a better dataset</strong>. Even though your goal model shouldn’t change entirely from the Global, you should find more localized data than the global data, because the global data layers have already been processed and include clipped regions that reduce the specificity of the information for your area. This is because in the default WebApp methods, the habitat area was calculated by using the global areal coverage of the habitat weighted by the size of the offshore area of the region. This is not consistent currently in the WebApps; for example, if you look at <a href="https://github.com/OHI-Science/col/blob/draft/subcountry2014/layers/hab_extent_gl2014.csv">the given layers a WebApp</a>, you will see that the same values are applied to all regions. You should think here, however, of how your regions’ size compare to any spatial dataset’s scale, and return to the question of spatial coverage once you are thinking about the <strong>reference points</strong> farther on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Questions to consider: Do you have maps, for example, that show current habitat distributions and maps that show historical habitat distributions? If so, you could extract that data for each of your regions to get a current and reference area. You may also have access to summarized habitat data that exists in tables or are already compiled in another source.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The types of habitat data you search for also matter. It is recommended to search for mangroves, saltmarshes, and sea grasses because these are viewed as carbon-sequestering habitats that are both ecologically threatened and sensitive to policy responses. You should remember that we recommend using habitats that can store carbon on the order of 100 years, thereby limiting the types of habitat types you will need. This would also affect other kinds of indicator considerations not discussed in the Global Assessments, such as chlorophyll abundance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TIP:, if you look at your default data on the WebApp, you will see <strong>Carbon Storage</strong> information presented for <strong>mangroves</strong>, <strong>salt marshes</strong>, and <strong>sea grass</strong> even if there are no mangroves in your area. You will not be scored on these if they are not in your area.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second group of items to consider are the <strong>condition</strong> and <strong>carbon contribution</strong>. <strong>Condition</strong> is more essential than <strong>contribution</strong> in this case because it is a more direct measure of ecosystem health and would give a more accurate score for this goal. <strong>Condition</strong> means . It can be measured by a number of ways, often indirectly through studies on density of the habitats, disease affecting the particular habitats, or other impacts such as change in species composition or growth rates from impacts such as overgrazing. Has there been a study assessing habitat integrity or health specifically in your area? <strong>Contribution</strong> is how much each habitat stores relatively to the others–such as the rates of carbon uptake as measured by empirical data. For this you would have to go to the literature and find ratios of organic nutrient uptake between habitats, and you would have to make sure these studies are done correctly to represent your area. For example, were the studies done with a young mangrove forest, or an older one, which might have different growth rates?</p>
<!---let's look into this more; I feel like this may not have been worded well and it might be misleading. OM: My question is whether Global 2012 used total extent 1km offshore, while 2013 used only 1km_offshore+1km_inland?--->
<blockquote>
<p>In the 2012 Global Assessment, the condition of mangroves was assessed as, “Current square kilometers of mangrove coverage divided by the reference hectares, calculated from 1980 to 2005.” [The rate of change on areal extent over the entire time-series was used as the trend.] Seagrass condition was calculated as, “Current percent cover, or hectares, of habitat divided by the reference percentage cover, or hectares from 1975 to 2010.” <!---See Table S7, Supplementary Information, Halpern et al. 2012, p. 24. Note that interestingly it does say salt marsh "condition" was calculated by an increasing or stable trend (value = 1), or by a decreasing trend (value = 0.5). Excluded it because it seems like an estimation.---></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A vital consideration for this goal is <strong>the reference point</strong>. It is an important decision to be made based on good science given the limitations of available data. The reference point is the extent of the habitat at some time in the past, in other words the ideal condition. You will need historical data for this–either from satellites, published papers, or even hand-drawn maps. For questions of sustainability, you must consider, what is a good year to set as your historical past extent? The reference year should be identified based on SMART principles, particularly that it is an ambitious goal, but also realistic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the U.S. West Coast assessment (2014), researchers went to the local public library to find hand-drawn maps of historical salt marsh extents in California.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, perhaps your choice of historical reference point may be guided by a policy target as well. For example, are there any climate change policies in your area, with defined targets and objectives? Are there any restoration or carbon storage projects in your area? Do any organizations offer guidance on the amount of carbon storage your management policies should be aiming for?</p>

<p>Ideally, data for all habitats within a region would be available, as well as information on the value of the land and the vulnerability of inhabitants being protected by these habitats. This requires data for habitat type at high spatial resolution as well as a measure of the value of what is protected by the habitats. The reference point for habitat-based goals will likely be a temporal baseline; this means that historic data are needed such that current habitat and value data can be compared to them.</p>

<div id="practical-approach-1" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.7.6.5</span> Practical Approach</h4>
<p>The areas relevant to this goal include both inhabited places, such as homes and other structures, and uninhabited places such as parks and special places. However, no credit is given for sea-walls, because they are not regarded as sustainable. At local and regional scales data may exist on all these variables at a high enough resolution to map and calculate exactly which habitats are providing how much protection to which coastal areas. You must first decide which data sources to use for your maps. Do you have spatially-explicit satellite data? If so, how far back in time does it go? The data consideration will be a consideration when you set the reference points.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the U.S. West Coast assessment (2014), researchers went to the local public library to find hand-drawn maps of historical sand-dunes in California, for example, in order to find information for sand dune extent in the 1850s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, one might want to know the level of vulnerability of the different coastal communities. Vulnerability can be quantified as the ability to evacuate, fragility of constructions, economic ability to reconstruct in case of damage. The the reason this is done is to prioritize the protection of certain locations. Physical properties may be available in regional studies, allowing for more a detailed understanding of the protective ability, and likelihood of exposure for each habitat type in different portions of the coastline.</p>
<p>As with the other habitat-based goals, you will need to make careful decisions about your reference point. It’s an important decision to be made based on good science given the limitations of available data. The reference point is the extent of the habitat at some time in the past, in other words the ideal condition. You will need historical data for this–either from satellites, published papers, or even hand-drawn maps. For questions of sustainability, you must consider, what is a good year to set as your historical past extent? Do you want to be ambitious and set it far in the past, so it gets closer to a more “pristine” condition? Or do you want to make it represent human use? Will it make your scores look better or worse if you choose a more recent or more distant example?</p>

<p>If comprehensive species biodiversity data exist, these data can be used alone and the sub-goal of habitats can be removed so that the entire goal is species biodiversity. However, the inventory of marine biodiversity may not often be sufficiently complete to permit that.</p>
<p>You should also think about the linkages between the habitat-based goals, such as <strong>Carbon Storage</strong> and <strong>Coastal Protection</strong>, and the pressures and resilience. Does the encroachment or reduction of these habitats have an effect on carbon sequestration, or does it change ecosystem composition sufficiently to impact species? Could habitats have an effect on <strong>Clean Waters</strong>, or are they impacted more by local pollution than other impacts? If habitats change for natural reasons, you might not need to worry about their pressures on other goals, but if they consist of introduced species, you should think about the effects on other goals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, the invasive marsh plants such as <em>Spartina</em> may afford some Carbon Storage, but it’s a non-native habitat to an area such as the San Francisco Bay.

<p>The first is to identify <strong>identify which products are in your study area.</strong> For example, does your study area have corals, ornamental fishes, sponges? Does your area yield medicines from the sea, or other products that are not used for nutrition under <strong>Food Provision</strong>? Does your area harvest drinking water from the ocean through desalination plants? Is there a kelp or seaweed industry in your area? If there are multiple uses of the product, you must also consider what proportion of the product is used for food, and what proportion is used for other purposes. As another example, oil from marine mammals was considered but excluded from the global models, but if a region has a considerable amount of mammal oil harvest, they should include it in the calculation, keeping in mind that the sustainability of this type of harvest is likely to be low and should be reflected in the score.</p>
<p>The second task is to think about <strong>where these products are harvested and how much of them are harvested</strong> in these areas through a period of time. You should find spatial representation of these products, which can be done by knowing where they are derived from. Do they come from certain habitats (in the case of coral) or animals (in the case of fish oil)? This information will help calculate the sustainability of the harvest of eah natural product. harvest amounts and the spatial data are used to calculate <strong>exposure</strong> further on, and can also be used to set the <strong>relative weighting</strong> between the products. These spatial data may have already been used in other goals, or they may lead you to find useful data that can be used in other parts of the assessment (See <strong>Best Approaches</strong>).</p>
<p>The second task is to think about <strong>where these products are harvested and how much of them are harvested</strong> in these areas through a period of time. You will have to assign geographic representation of these products, which can be done by knowing where they are derived from, ideally, or by assigning relative weightings. Do they come from certain habitats (in the case of coral) or animals (in the case of fish oil)? This information will help calculate the sustainability of the harvest of eah natural product. harvest amounts and the spatial data are used to calculate <strong>exposure</strong> further on, and can also be used to set the <strong>relative weighting</strong> between the products. These spatial data may have already been used in other goals, or they may lead you to find useful data that can be used in other parts of the assessment (See <strong>Best Approaches</strong>).</p>
<p>The third component is to try to find the <strong>sustainability</strong> coefficients of the identified products. It is possible to measure sustainability in a number of different ways. Quantitative information can be used, or expert judgment, perhaps based on information or rough estimates of how sustainable the harvest method is, which is what was done in Global 2012. We based the sustainability component on the historical maximum harvest recorded, the maximum harvesting density recorded, and risk status assessments by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). In the absence of these, we borrowed general principles from fisheries models to provide rough estimates. If these are given values you could simplify the model, or they could be derived from two factors, <strong>exposure and risk</strong>. The <strong>exposure</strong> will come from the spatio-temporal harvest amount data already prepared, and the <strong>risk</strong> will come from the scientific literature or a developed indicator. For both of those cases, the values can be calculated in separate equations as part of your data preparation process.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>One very important thing to consider at this point is your <strong>reference point for the relative harvest amount</strong>. The relative harvest of your data is multiplied by the sustainability coefficient in the last step. Setting the reference point is a decision your team must make based on the available data and an inferred functional relationship between the harvest of the product and the amount in the system. Understanding the patterns in harvest can help inform how to set the reference point. For example, knowing whether harvesting effort was constant or whether product yields changed due to the market demand and not the availability. This information could help inform whether it is more appropriate to set the reference point as the peak yield of the time-series, or some percentage above or below, or some other approach that is both ambitious and realistic (<strong>SMART</strong> principles). The decision you make for the reference point should be based on the trend of the data; for instance, if your harvests have only increased over time, which may be indicative of an emerging economy, you will have to account for that.</p>

<div id="pressures-and-resilience" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.8</span> Pressures and resilience</h2>
<p><strong>Pressures</strong> and <strong>Resilience</strong> are two of the four dimensions used to evaluate each goal or sub-goal, along with <strong>Status</strong> and <strong>Trend</strong>.</p>
<p>It is important to identify the pressures that affect the ocean and coastal systems in your study area, and to search for additional pressures not included the global assessments. Once you have identified pressures within your study area, you should identify what resilience measures could counteract or nullify those pressures. Alternatively, you can start with a list of known resiliences, such as the relevant environmental laws in your country, and them map them onto pressure layers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TIP: The same considerations and requirements about data presented in the “<strong>Gathering Appropriate Data</strong>” section also apply to pressures and resilience. Every measure you include for pressures and resilience requires data for each region in your assessment.</p>
</blockquote>
<div id="ideal-approach-4" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.8.1</span> <em>Ideal Approach</em>:</h3>
<p>Ideally, every stressor with an identified strong impact should have a corresponding resilience measure. The rationale is that as resiliences in the study area increase (for instance, by improving environmental regulations), they would balance out and eventually neutralize the pressures. This would lead to an increase in the overall goal or sub-goal score. By including regulatory responses in your assessment, you ensure that the actions taken in your country are relevant to ocean health.</p>
<p>In practice, however, the pressures and resilience measures you include in your assessment will be highly determined by data availability. It is best to first consider what pressures are acting in your study area and then determine if data are available to measure them. You should also decide if the pressures data included in the global assessment are relevant for your assessment and determine if local data better capture pressures for all the regions in your study area. When considering resilience measures, look for regulations or indicators that could be encompassed in one of the pressures categories.</p>
<div id="pressure-and-resilience-categories" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.8.1.1</span> Pressure and resilience categories</h4>
<p>The Toolbox calculates pressures in five ecological pressure categories (pollution, habitat destruction, fishing pressure, species pollution, and climate change) and one social pressure category. The reason behind the ecological categories is to avoid hidden weighting (e.g., overrepresentation of pressures for which there is more data). For example, in the global assessment there were many pollution datasets available, but few distinct habitat destruction datasets. If we simply averaged the scores of each individual stressor, pollution scores would have a greater influence on the results (stronger weight) due to the relative higher availability of measurements of various pollutants. Instead, aggregating by pressure categories ensures that different stressor types influence the score based on ranks. Nonetheless, the scores are combined in a cumulative way within each category to account for the fact that multiple stressors within a category have a cumulative impact that is greater than if only one of the stressors were present. The resulting scores for the five ecological categories are averaged to produce a single ecological pressures score. This score is then averaged with the social pressures score to produce the final overall pressure score.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="pressures-and-resilience-matrices" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.8.2</span> Pressures and resilience matrices</h3>
<p>After you identify the pressures and resilience measures for your study area are and gather available data for each region, you will use matrix tables to determine how each of the measures affects each goal and sub-goal (for some goals you will also need to do this for habitat type or natural product categories). The pressures matrix establishes the relationships between stressors and goals are determined, and uses a rank from 1-3 to weight how strongly a given pressure affects a goal or sub-goal relative to all the other pressures affecting it.</p>
<p>The rank weights used in the pressures matrix were determined by Halpern <em>et al</em>. 2012 (<em>Nature</em>) based on scientific literature and expert opinion (see Supplemental Table S28 of <em>Halpern et al. 2012</em>). In the pressures matrix ranks are categorized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 = high pressure</li>
<li>2 = medium pressure</li>
<li>1 = low pressure</li>
</ul>
<p>Stressors that have no impact are not included rather than being assigned a rank of zero, which would affect the average score. Pressures are ranked rather than being represented as a binary (yes/no) measure because the range of consequence of different pressures on each goal can be quite large, and to classify all those pressures as a simple ‘yes’ would give too much influence to the weakest stressors. For example, food provision is most heavily impacted by unsustainable, high-bycatch fishing, but pollution does have some impact on fish populations. Without a weighting system, these stressors would be treated equally in their impact on the food provision goal.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/ohiman_goals-pressures-2D.png" alt="Scores from 1-3 are given to rank the importance of each pressure. Only values of 2 or 3 require that a resilience layer be activated when calculating the goal scores." />
<p class="caption">Scores from 1-3 are given to rank the importance of each pressure. Only values of 2 or 3 require that a resilience layer be activated when calculating the goal scores.</p>
</div>
<p>While pressures and resilience are usually displayed as two-dimensional matrices, they are actually three-dimensional matrices: each stressor should have data for each region in the study area, which is the third dimension of the matrix, as shown in the figure. The Toolbox will combine the data with the rank weights to calculate the pressures scores. Therefore, pressure weights should not be applied to the regions, but only to the goals. The Toolbox will multiply the stressor score for each region by the weight (1, 2, 3) assigned to that pressure for a specific goal and subgoal, and then it will combined that score within its appropriate pressure category as previously discussed.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/ohiman_goals-pressures-regions.png" alt="The pressures matrix is three-dimensional: each pressure layer has data per region, which is multiplied by the ranking weights of the pressures matrix." />
<p class="caption">The pressures matrix is three-dimensional: each pressure layer has data per region, which is multiplied by the ranking weights of the pressures matrix.</p>
</div>
<p>Each pressure with a rank weight of 2 or 3 should have a corresponding resilience measure, which is meant to ‘balance’ the pressures since these have the greatest effect on ocean health. The Ocean Health Index considers resilience in two categories: <strong>ecological resilience</strong> to address ecological pressures, and <strong>social resilience</strong>, which may not be strictly marine-related, but they can help estimate how a region may be able to respond to or prevent new environmental challenges. Additionally, <strong>goal-specific regulations</strong> are intended to address ecological pressures, and are measured as laws, regulations, and other institutional measures related to a specific goal. Ideally, for any resilience measure, you would have three tiers of information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Existence of regulations</strong>: Are regulations in place to appropriately address the ecological pressure?</li>
<li><strong>Implementation and enforcement</strong>: Have these regulations been appropriately implemented and are there enforcement mechanisms in place?</li>
<li><strong>Effectiveness and compliance</strong>: How effective have the regulations been at mitigating these pressures and is there compliance with these regulations?</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally, information would exist for these three tiers, and you would be able to weight the resilience measure based on the quality of the information as 1 (existence of regulation), 2 (implementation and enforcement), or 3 (effectiveness and compliance). This approach is different from the way ranks are assigned in pressures, which is based on impact. However, in most cases, information is not available for these three tiers: often, the existence of regulations is all that is available, and this does not always vary by region. In some cases, you may want to consider building your own set of indicators to determine <strong>implementation and enforcement</strong> and <strong>effectiveness and compliance.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="incorporating-local-pressures-in-your-assessment" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.8.3</span> Incorporating local pressures in your assessment</h3>
<p>The pressures you will include in your assessment will depend on what is important in your study area and what data are available. If local pressures data are not available, you may default to using data from the global assessment, but this means in most cases that you will not have different information for each region (See <strong>Including pressures from global assessments</strong>). You will determine the weight ranks required in the pressures matrix only after you have identified the data you will include.</p>
<p>The following steps outline the process of how to include pressures in your assessment. The steps are iterative; return to previous steps to ensure you capture all important pressures in your study area:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Begin by exploring pressures important to your study area. What are big stressors acting along your coastlines?</li>
<li>Are data available to measure these stressors? If not, are other indirect measures or proxies available to represent these stressors?</li>
<li>Evaluate the pressures included in the global assessment. For example, if there is no mariculture in your study area, you could remove pressures data layers that only affect this goal (i.e. genetic escapes).</li>
<li>Are all of them relevant? Are there local data that can be substituted in the place of global data?</li>
<li>Determine the pressure category for any additional stressors in your study area, and add it to the pressures matrix.</li>
<li>When all stressors are included in the pressures matrix, determine which goals it affects. Then, determine the weight rankings of all stressors for each goal. Use literature and expert judgement to determine this.</li>
<li>Prepare each pressure data layer as described in this manual only after steps 1-6 are completed. In addition to the proper formatting for the Toolbox, pressures data must be rescaled (normalized) on a unitless scale from 0 - 1, where 0 is no stressor at all and 1 is the highest possible value for the stressor, or the value at which the goal achievement is completely impaired. You will have to determine how to rescale the data, whether it is based on the highest value in the data range or other methods.</li>

<p>Note that chemical and nutrient pollution have both land-based (within 3 nautical miles) and ocean-based (within the entire 200 nautical mile EEZ) elements. This is because how pollution affects different goals will depend on the spatial scale of the goal’s activity. Some goals occur far from shore, and nutrient and chemical pollution should be included for all offshore waters: FIS, MAR, ECO, and SPP. However, some goals are really only relevant nearshore, so nutrient and chemical pollution should only be included close to the shoreline (3nm in the global study): AO, CS, CP, TR, ICO, LSP, HAB.</p>
<p>These distinctions won’t always apply for smaller-scale assessments. For example, in the US West Coast study (Halpern <em>et al.</em> 2014), we did not distinguish between offshore and 3nm and therefore only used the <code>po_nutrients</code> data layer.</p>

<div id="ideal-approach-5" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.9.1</span> Ideal Approach</h3>
<p>Ideally, assessments of social resilience would include national-level and as well as local rules and other relevant institutional mechanisms that are meant to safeguard ocean health. The global focus has been on international treaties and indices, so your region should have more localized information. There would also be information as to their effectiveness and enforcement. of more. Information on social norms and community (and other local-scale) institutions (such as tenure or use rights) that influence resource use and management would be useful too.</p>
<div id="practical-considerations-2" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.9.1.1</span> Practical Considerations</h4>
<p>In practical terms, resilience is hard to define and finding data can be difficult. It is often difficult to find regulations and indicators that would directly ‘balance’ individual stressors, but it is worth the effort to explore what information is available in the local context and how it could be included as resilience measures. You may be able to construct your own set of indicators for resilience (particularly social resilience) using proxy data. Your team may have to get creative to develop appropriate assessment measures here. It can be metrically be defined as presence-versus-absence (value of zero or one), or on a scale (value between zero and one) if the measure is an assessment or score. For instance in the global study, resilience measures that were counted in the socio-economic resilience class of data came from the World Governance Indicators (<a href="http://govindicators.org" class="uri">http://govindicators.org</a>). In a regional context, however, a more appropriate data layer might be a local governance index of some kind, preferably developed by a reputable organization using credible methods.</p>
<p>When available, National-level data are preferable to global-level data for your assessment. These include national laws on the environment, or protection of the marine environment or rivers that lead to coastal waters. National laws include things like the Clean Water Act (CWA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in the U.S., or the national implementations of the E.U. Water Framework Directive. National actions can also be broadened beyond just legislation to include administrative procedures such as those involving permits, licenses, court cases, administrative action, and compliance mechanisms. [Cultural items at the national scale, such as holidays, are also applied at this scale]</p>
<p>State or province-level laws provide more regionally-specific information and thus work well for assessments. This would involve looking at the same types of laws and policies that exist on the national level, but specifically incorporating those that have been tailored to fit the needs of a particular sub-national area. This includes things such as California’s state-level California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), or the California Ocean Protection Act (COPA), which have laws designed specifically to protect California’s environment. This would tell you more relevant information than using data from a national or international law. Local level regulations will usually provide you with the most accurate information for your assessment in order to tailor it best to the local context.</p>
</div>
<div id="scoring-turning-qualitative-into-quantitative" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.9.1.2</span> Scoring: Turning Qualitative into Quantitative</h4>
<p>There are several ways to turn the qualitative information of regulations and social actions into quantitative metrics for analysis. A robust way is to give credit for different aspects of the resilience measures. In addition to a score for having the law, policy, or action, in place, it is possible to gauge the effectiveness of that activity.</p>
<p>The simplest way is to give credit for having a resilience measure in place. This means assigning a binary score of zero or one for “presence” versus “absence” of the resilience measure. For international conventions, this can be done by assigning a value of 1 for having signed a convention. A more rigorous score can be given for countries that have further <em>ratified</em> a convention in addition to signing it; this is one way to further differentiate scores. This can be done by seeing if a country has signed and ratified CITES, for example.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, if you were trying to find out if there are regulations in place that guide fishing pressure, you could look see if regulations exist for trawl-fishing limitations, or see if there are regulations for fish size, length, or if there are any seasonal restrictions. Another option would be to see if formal stock assessments exist for commercially-fished species.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A further step is to assess how well those measures are being complied with. This will give you more robust way is to assess how well a resilience mechanism is working to maintain the integrity of the regulation and thereby the ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, once you have found out whether regulations for fishing pressure exist, you would then try to find values for compliance with these regulations. These could be raw data or calculated statistics such as rate of compliance or proportion of compliance. It should answer the question, “Are there indicators of compliance with fishing pressure guidelines”?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A subsequent, and final, step to creating a robust resilience assessment is to determine whether there are enforcement mechanisms in place to deal with non-compliance of the regulations. This is because a regulation is only as good as its implementation, and having both enforcement and compliance actions in place would reinforce the regulation and make it more effective.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, in the case of fishing pressures, a further look into available data could lead you learn whether there are reported values of inspector visits and enforcement coverage of permitted facilities. Or you could look at reported numbers of enforcement actions in response to non-compliance. Further, you could also see if there are fines that have been paid or exist in association with non-compliance.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="data-sources-1" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.9.1.3</span> Data sources</h4>
<!---Link to Courtney's Google Doc-->
<p>Environmental laws and policies offer tangible information on resilience. The most common type of environmental regulations come from administrative law, such as pollution regulation of various kinds. Land-use law is also important to the integration of social and ecosystem issues, so finding zoning laws relevant for coastal areas could be useful, and so could finding whether or not a region requires environmental impact statements before allowing construction for either coastal land or for marine planning. Other kinds of law some countries include court cases settling disputes or requiring reparation of pollution damages, for example.</p>
<p>Resilience also goes beyond just the law, however. Insurance policies present another option, for instance.. Coastal areas are increasingly requiring climate-related insurance in some countries, and so the existence of such markets in a vulnerable area would be an example of a climate change resilience measure. Social initiatives also present another way to tackle resilience. There might be a beach clean-up day, a percentage of the refuse material that is recycled by the population, or some other social factor that reduces trash inputs into the ocean. A local law banning plastic bags is another way that local jurisdictions control plastic trash.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Brazil study (2014), the marine trash resilience was calculated by counting up whether localities had one of four garbage management services, including access to beach clean-up services, household garbage collection, household recycling collection, and garbage collection in public streets. <!---Julie's MS---></p>

In addition to the proper formatting for the Toolbox, resilience data must be rescaled (normalized) on a unitless scale from 0 - 1. You will have to determine how to rescale the data, whether it is based on the highest value in the data range or other methods.</li>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> The Ocean Health Index Toolbox</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Section Summary:</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In this section, you will learn the basics of how to use OHI tools for conducting an assessment. You will be introduced to the files you will be working with, how to prepare them, and you will learn how concepts such as status, trend, pressures, and resilience are used together to create the final score. You will also learn what to do in cases of missing data.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>TIP: Knowing where your data gaps are will make gapfilling easier in this process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The OHI Toolbox</strong> is an ecosystem of data, scripts, and structure required to calculate OHI scores at any scale. Toolbox scripts are open source, written in the software language R, and data inputted into the Toolbox are <strong>comma-separated-value</strong>, or <em>.csv</em> files, which can be created or edited using text editors or Microsoft Excel. Files are stored within two folders called <strong>repositories</strong>, or <em>(repos)</em>, such that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OHI Toolbox = your assessment repo + <code>ohi core functions</code> repo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We access and interact with the Toolbox ecosystem through an online collaborative platform called <strong>GitHub</strong>. GitHub stores the <strong>R</strong> scripts and <em>.csv</em> files in a folder called a repository, which is found online and can also be downloaded on your computer and synced with the online version. GitHub tracks changes by all collaborators working on the project through time, and saves all versions for comparison. The section, “<strong>Installing the Toolbox</strong>,” provides instruction on how to download GitHub repositories to your computer, but everything is also available online.</p>
<p>The Toolbox is used to calculate final scores. But, perhaps more importantly, it can also be used to organize an assessment, including data identification and management. The Toolbox can additionally be used to compare how different management scenarios could affect overall ocean health, which can inform effective strategies for ocean resource management at a local scale.</p>
<div id="file-system-for-assessment-repositories" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> File System for Assessment Repositories</h2>
<p>This section is an orientation to the files within your assessment repository. The file system structure is the same whether you view your assessment repository online or after downloading or cloning to your computer (see section, <strong>“Installing the Toolbox”</strong>).</p>
<p>Throughout this example, we will use Ecuador’s assessment repository as a guide. It’s available at <a href="https://github.com/OHI-Science/ecu" class="uri">https://github.com/OHI-Science/ecu</a>.</p>

<div id="assessments-and-scenarios" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Assessments and scenarios</h3>
<p>Your <em>assessment repository</em> contains a <em>scenario folder</em>, which by default is named <code>subcountry2014</code>. This scenario folder contains all the files needed to calculate scores, and they are described in detail below.</p>
<p>The scenario folder is named <code>subcountry2014</code> because it contains data for your country used in the 2014 global assessment. These data in most cases were attributed equally to all regions within your study area (for example, data used for Ecuador in the global assessment was attributed to all coastal states in the files within <code>subcountry2014</code>).</p>
<p>You will be able to rename your scenario folder to better reflect the spatial and temporal scale of your scenario after you have set up your GitHub account. We recommend that the name defines the scale of the regions and the year. Eventually, you will likely have multiple scenario folders that contain data for subsequent years or modifications to explore policy alternatives.</p>

<p><code>layers.csv</code> is the registry that manages all data required for the assessment. All relevant data are prepared as a ‘data layer’ and registered in this file. The Toolbox will rely on information from this file to use the data layers and display information on the WebApp. You will update some of the layers in <code>layers.csv</code>, and some of them will be auto-generated by the Toolbox code when it’s running.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Formatting Data for the Toolbox</h2>
<div id="introduction" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Introduction</h3>
<p>The OHI Toolbox is designed to work in the programming language <strong>R</strong> using input data stored in text-based <em>.csv</em> files (<em>csv</em> stands for ‘comma-separated value’; these files can be opened as a spreadsheet using Microsoft Excel or similar programs). Each data layer (data input) has its own <em>.csv</em> file, which is combined with others within the Toolbox for the model calculations. These data layers are used for calculating goal scores, meaning that they are inputs for status, trend, pressures, and resilience. The global analysis included over 100 data layer files, and there will probably be as many in your own assessments. This section describes and provides examples of how to format the data layers for the Toolbox.</p>
<p>OHI goal scores are calculated at the scale of the reporting unit, which is called a ‘<strong>region</strong>’ and then combined using an area-weighted average to produce the score for the overall area assessed, called a ‘<strong>study area</strong>’. The OHI Toolbox expects each data file to be in a specific format, with data available for every region within the study area, with data layers organized in ‘long’ format (as few columns as possible), and with a unique region identifier (<em>rgn_id</em>) associated with a single <em>score</em> or <em>value</em>. In order to calculate trend, input data must be available as a time series for at least 5 recent years (and the longer the time series the better, as this can be used in setting temporal reference points).</p>
<p>The example below shows information for a study area with 4 regions. There are two different (and separate) data layer files: tourism count (<code>tr_total.csv</code>) and natural products harvested, in metric tonnes (<code>np_harvest_tonnes.csv</code>). Each file has data for four regions (1-4) in different years, and the second has an additional ‘categories’ column for the different types of natural products that were harvested. In this example, the two data layers are appropriate for status calculations with the Toolbox because:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>At least five years of data are available,</li>
<li>There are no data gaps</li>
<li>Data are presented in ‘long’ or ‘narrow’ format (not ‘wide’ format – see “<strong>Long Formatting</strong>”&quot; section).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example of data in the appropriate format:</strong></p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
</div>
<div id="gapfilling" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> Gapfilling</h3>
<p>It is important that data prepared for the Toolbox have no missing values or ‘gaps’. Data gaps can occur in two main ways: 1) <strong>temporal gaps</strong>: when several years in a time series in a single region have missing data, and 2) <strong>spatial gaps</strong>: when all years for a region have missing data (and therefore the whole region is ‘missing’ for that data layer).</p>
<p>How these gaps are filled will depend on the data and regions themselves, and requires thoughtful, logical decisions to most reasonably fill gaps. Each data layer can be gapfilled using different approaches. Some data layers will require both temporal and spatial gapfilling. The examples below highlight some example of temporal and spatial gapfilling.</p>
<p>All decisions of gapfilling should be documented to ensure transparency and reproducibility. The examples below are in Excel, but programming these changes in software like R is preferred because it promotes easy transparency and reproducibility.</p>
<div id="temporal-gapfilling" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2.1</span> Temporal gapfilling</h4>
<p>Temporal gaps occur when a region is missing data for some years. The Toolbox requires data for each year for every region. It is important to make an informed decision about how to temporally gapfill data.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/temporal_gaps.png" />

</div>
<p>Often, regression models are the best way to estimate data and fill temporal gaps. Here we give an example that assumes a linear relationship between the year and value variables within a region. If data do not fit a linear framework, other models may be fit to help with gapfilling. Here we give an example assuming linearity.</p>
<p>Using a linear model can be done in most programming languages using specific functions, but here we show this step-by-step using functions in Excel for Region 1.</p>
<p><strong>Temporal gapfilling example (assumes linearity: able to be represented by a straight line on a graph)):</strong></p>
<p>There are four steps to temporally gapfill with a linear model, illustrated in the figures with four columns.</p>
<p><strong>1. Calculate the slope for each region</strong></p>
<p>The first step is to calculate the slope of the line that is fitted through the available data points. This can be done in Excel using the <strong>SLOPE(known_y’s,known_x’s)</strong> function as highlighted in the figure below. In this case, the x-axis is <em>years</em> (2005, 2006, etc…), the y-axis is <em>count</em>, and the Excel function automatically plots and fits a line through the known values (177.14 in 2005, 212.99 in 2008, and 228.81 in 2009), and subsequently calculates the slope (12.69).</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/filling_temporal_gaps_slope.png" />

</div>
<p><strong>2. Calculate the y-intercept for each region</strong></p>
<p>The next step is to calculate the intercept of the line that is fitted through the available data points. This can be done in Excel similarly as for the slope calculation, using the the <strong>INTERCEPT(known_y’s,known_x’s)</strong> function that calculates the y-intercept (-25273.89) of the fitted line.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/filling_temporal_gaps_intercept.png" />

</div>
<p><strong>3. Calculate y for all years</strong></p>
<p>The slope and y-intercept that were calculated in steps 1 and 2 can then be used along with the year (independent variable) to calculate the unknown ‘y-values’. To do so, simply replace the known three values into the <strong>y = mx + b</strong> equation (m=slope, x=year, b=intercept), to calculate the unknown ‘count’ for a given year (189.39 in 2006, and 202.08 in 2007).</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/filling_temporal_gaps_value.png" />

</div>
<p><strong>4. Replace modeled values into original data where gaps had occurred</strong></p>
<p>Substitute these modeled values that were previously gaps in the timeseriew. <em>The data layer is now ready for the Toolbox, gapfilled and in the appropriate format.</em></p>
</div>
<div id="spatial-gapfilling" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2.2</span> Spatial gapfilling</h4>
<p>Spatial gaps are when no data are available for a particular region. The Toolbox requires data for each region. It is important to make an informed decision about how to spatially gapfilling data.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/gapfilling_spatial.png" />

</div>
<p>To fill gaps spatially, you must assume that one region is like another, and data from another region is adequate to be substituted in place of the missing data. This will depend on the type of data and the properties of the regions requiring gapfilling. For example, if a region is missing data but has similar properties to a different region that does have data, the missing data could be ‘borrowed’ from the region with information. Each data layer can be gapfilled using a different approach when necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics of regions requiring gapfilling that can help determine which type of spatial gapfilling to use:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>proximity: can it be assumed that nearby regions have similar properties?</p></li>
<li><p>study area: are data reported for the study area, and can those data be used for subcountry regions?</p></li>
<li><p>demographic information: can it be assumed a region with a similar population size has similar data?</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Spatial gapfilling example:</strong></p>
<p>For a certain data layer, suppose the second region (<em>rgn_id 2</em>) has no data reported, as illustrated in the figure above. How to spatially gapfill <em>rgn_id 2</em> requires thinking about the properties and characteristics of the region and the data, in this case, tourist count.</p>
<p>Here are properties that can be important for decision making:</p>
<p><em>rgn_id 2</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>is located between <em>rgn_id 1</em> and 3</li>
<li>is larger than <em>rgn_id 1</em></li>
<li>has similar population size/demographics to <em>rgn_id 3</em></li>
<li>has not been growing as quickly as <em>rgn_id 4</em></li>
</ul>
<p>There is no absolute answer of how to best gapfill <em>rgn_id 2</em>. Here are a few reasonable possibilities:</p>
<p>Assign <em>rgn_id 2</em> values from:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>rgn_id 1</em> because it is in close proximity to <em>rgn_id 2</em></li>
<li><em>rgn_id 3</em> because it is in close proximity to <em>rgn_id 2</em> and has similar population size/demographics</li>
<li><em>rgn_id 1</em> and 3 averaged since they are in close proximity to <em>rgn_id 2</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Suppose the decision was made to gapfill <em>rgn_id 2</em> using the mean of <em>rgn_id 1</em> and <em>3</em> since this would use a combination of both of those regions. Again, other possibilities could be equally correct. But some form of spatial gapfilling is required so a decision must be made. The image below illustrates this in Excel.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/gapfilling_spatial_example.png" />

</div>
<p>The data layer is now ready for the Toolbox, gapfilled and in the appropriate format.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="long-formatting" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.3</span> Long formatting</h3>
<p>The Toolbox expects data to be in ‘long’ or ‘narrow’ format. Below are examples of correct and incorrect formatting, and tips on how to transform data into the appropriate format.</p>
<p><strong>Example of data in an incorrect format:</strong></p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/formatting_long_example.png" />

</div>
<p>With ‘wide’ format, data layers are more difficult to combine with others and more difficult to read and to analyze.</p>
<p><strong>Transforming data into ‘narrow’ format:</strong></p>
<p>Data are easily transformed in a programming language such as R.</p>
<p>In R, the <code>reshape</code> package has the <code>melt</code> command, which will melt the data from a wide format into a narrow format. It also can <code>cast</code> the data back into a wide format if desired. R documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape2/reshape2.pdf" class="uri">http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape2/reshape2.pdf</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Example code using the <em>melt</em> command in the <em>reshape2</em> library. Assume the data above is in a variable called <em>data_wide</em>:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/melt_code.png" />

</div>
<p>This will melt everything except any identified columns (<em>Region</em> and <em>DataLayer</em>), and put all other column headers into a new column named <em>Year</em>. Data values will then be found in a new column called <em>value</em>.</p>
<p>The final step is optional: ordering the data will make it easier for humans to read (R and the Toolbox can read these data without this final step):</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Overview</h2>
<p>The <strong>OHI Toolbox</strong> is essentially several folders containing all the files required for an OHI assessment. These folders are stored online on www.github.com, and are called <strong>GitHub repositories</strong>. At this point, you should already be familiar with your assessment’s repository, and all of the files it contains (if not, read the section, “<strong>File System for Assessment Repositories</strong>”).</p>
<p>Conducting an OHI assessment using GitHub enables collaboration and transparency, and will provide access to the latest developments in the Toolbox software, allowing the OHI team to provide support remotely if necessary.</p>
<p>This section explains the GitHub workflow and how to access and setup required software. Then, it explains how to after modifying files on your own computer, you can use GitHub to upload any modifications you make so that you can work collaboratively with your team.</p>

<p><strong>GitHub</strong> is an open-source development platform that enables easy collaboration and versioning, which means that all saved versions are archived and attributed to each user. It is possible to revert back to any previous version, which is incredibly useful to not only to document what work has been done, but how it differs from work done in the past, and who is responsible for the changes.</p>
<p><strong>GitHub Vocabulary:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>clone</strong> ~ download to your computer from online version with synching capabilities enabled</li>
<li><strong>commit</strong> ~ message associated with your changes at a point in time</li>
<li><strong>pull</strong> ~ sync a repo on your computer with online version</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Accessing GitHub Repositories</h2>
<p>GitHub has an online interface and a desktop application for the version-control software called ** <em>git</em>. ** In addition to cloning your GitHub repository to your computer, you will need to download and install <em>git</em> software and the GitHub App (application), both of which are freely available.</p>
<div id="create-a-github-account" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.1</span> Create a GitHub account</h3>
<p>Create a GitHub account at <a href="http://github.com" class="uri">http://github.com</a>. Choose a username and password. You will use this username and password when you install and set up <em>git</em> on your computer.</p>
</div>
<div id="install-git-software" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.2</span> Install <em>git</em> software</h3>
<p>How you install <em>git</em> will depend on whether you are working on a Windows or Mac computer. It will also depend on your operating system version. If you have problems following these instructions, it is likely because your operating system requires a previous version of <em>git</em>. Previous versions are available from <a href="http://www.wandisco.com/git/download" class="uri">http://www.wandisco.com/git/download</a> (you will need to provide your email address).</p>
<p><strong>For Windows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Download <em>git</em> at <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads" class="uri">http://git-scm.com/downloads</a> and follow the install instructions.</p></li>
<li><p>When running the Windows installer, use all default options except “Adjusting your PATH environment”: instead, select “<em><strong>Run Git from the Windows Command Prompt</strong></em>”. This will allow later compatibility with RStudio.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>For Mac:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Download <em>git</em> at <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads" class="uri">http://git-scm.com/downloads</a> and follow the install instructions.</li>
<li>Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a> has a command line tools option during install which can override the preferred <em>git</em> command line tools. To ensure you are using the latest preferred version of <em>git</em>, you will need to launch Terminal and type the following few lines of code:</li>
<li>Access Terminal from the Applications folder: <strong>Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Terminal</strong>. When you launch Terminal a window will appear with your computer’s name followed by a <code>$</code>. When you type, your commands will appear after the <code>$</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Add access your ‘bash profile’ by typing:</p>
<pre><code>pico ~/.bash_profile</code></pre>
<p>You are now able to edit your ‘bash profile’. Type:</p>
<pre><code>export PATH=/usr/local/git/bin:$PATH</code></pre>
<p>Exit pico by typing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>control-X<br />y<br />return/enter</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.3</span> Set up your Git Identity</h3>
<p>After downloading and installing <em>git</em>, you will need to set up your <strong>Git Identity</strong>, which identifies you with your work. <em>Note</em>: if you have any problems with the following instructions, it is likely because of incompatibility between the version of your operating system and the version of git you downloaded in the previous section. In this case, find and download a compatible version at <a href="www.wandisco.com/git/download" class="uri">www.wandisco.com/git/download</a> and then follow the instructions below.</p>
<p>You will set up your GitHub identity using the command line specific to Windows or Mac:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows</strong>: Start &gt; Run &gt; cmd</li>
<li><strong>Mac</strong>: Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Terminal</li>
</ul>
<p>In the window, you will see a cursor where you are able to type. Type the following and press return (or enter) at each step. Make sure all spaces and symbols are identical to the example below, including all spaces ( ) and dashes (-).</p>
<p>Substitute your GitHub username instead of jdoe:</p>
<pre><code>git config --global user.name jdoe</code></pre>
<p>and then: substitute the email address you used to create your GitHub account:</p>
<pre><code>git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com</code></pre>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.5</span> Create a folder called <em>github</em> on your computer</h3>
<p>Because you will use GitHub to collaborate with your team or request support from the OHI team, it is important you save files in places where the file path that is universal and not specific to your computer. When team members save files in different places, this will create a lot of problems when collaborating, particularly between Macs and Windows machines.</p>
<p><strong>Please create a folder called github in your root directory</strong>. The file path for this folder will be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows</strong>: <code>Users\[User]\Documents\github\</code></li>
<li><strong>Mac</strong>: <code>Users/[User]/github/</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This folder can be identified by any computer as <code>~/github/</code>.</p>

<p>You will be asked where to save this repository: save it into the <code>github</code> folder you created. The file path for your assessment will therefore be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows: C: <code>\Users\[User]\Documents\github\[assessment] (example: C:\Users\johndoe\Documents\github\ecu)</code></li>
<li>on a Mac: <code>/Users/[User]/github/[assessment] (example: /Users/johndoe/github/ecu)</code></li>

<div id="update-permissions" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.7</span> Update permissions</h3>
<p>You need to **email your username to <a href="mailto:ohi-science@nceas.ucsb.edu*">ohi-science@nceas.ucsb.edu*</a>* for permission to upload modifications to your GitHub repository (you only need to do this once). Only team members who will be modifying files will need to do this; all other members can view online and download the repository without these permissions.</p>
</div>
<div id="work-locally" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.8</span> Work locally</h3>
<p>You will then work locally on your own computer, modifying the files in the repository to reflect the desired modifications your team has identified for your assessment. Multiple users can work on the same repository at the same time, so there are steps involved to ‘check in’ your modifications so they can merge with the work of others without problems. GitHub has specific words for each of these steps. You have already successfully <strong>cloned</strong> an online repository to your local machine. After making modifications, you will <strong>commit</strong> these changes with a description before being able to sync back to the online repository. <strong>Synching</strong> involves both <strong>pulling</strong> any updates from the online repository before <strong>pushing</strong> committed changes back to the server.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TIP: While you can edit files in the online GitHub repository, we do not recommend this. It is good practice to track changes through commits and syncing.</p>

<p><strong>All changes within your local repository will be tracked by GitHub regardless of the software you use to make the changes</strong>. This means that you can delete or paste files in the Mac Finder or Windows Explorer and edit <em>.csv</em> files in Excel or a text editor, and still sync these changes with the online repository. We recommend doing as much data manipulation as possible in a programming language like R, to maximize transparency and reproducibility. When modifying R scripts such as <code>functions.R</code>, you will need to work in R.</p>
<p>We recommend syncing with either the GitHub App or with RStudio. Both methods require you to commit your changes, before pulling any updates and pushing your modifications. The GitHub App combines the pulling and pushing into one step, called syncing. The following sections show you how to synchronize the repository on your computer with the repository online.</p>
</div>
<div id="syncing" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.9</span> Syncing</h3>
<p>When you work on your computer, any edits you make to any files in your repo, using any program, will be tracked by <em>git</em>. You can use any of the above to commit and sync your changes back to GitHub. There are many options you can use to sync your edits on a repo with the online version.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GitHub App</strong> <a href="https://mac.github.com/">for Mac</a> and <a href="https://windows.github.com/">for Windows</a></li>

</ul>
<p>If you are just modifying data <em>.csv</em> files, you probably only need to use the GitHub App. RStudio is convenient if you are working with <em>.R</em> files. Also, the command line can be used by those interested, and there are resources available online.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.11</span> Working with R and RStudio</h3>
<p><strong>RStudio</strong> is a program that can be used to synchronize any modifications you make to files in your assessment’s repository, and if you are working in R, it is convenient since you do not need to open the GitHub App. If you do not already have this installed, install the latest version of R and RStudio (and if you do have these installed, check for updates: there are frequent updates to the R software, and the current version is identified on the website). Both R and RStudio are freely available to download.</p>
<p><strong>R</strong>: Download the current version of R appropriate for your operating system at <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/" class="uri">http://cran.r-project.org/</a> and follow the instructions to install it on your computer. If updating, compare the available version on their website with what you already have on your computer by typing sessionInfo() into your R console.</p>
<p><strong>RStudio</strong>: Download the current version of RStudio software at www.rstudio.com. RStudio is not updated as often as R, but it is good to check for updates regularly. Note that in this case, you should follow the default install instructions.</p>
<p>If you are working on a Mac, you will need to tell RStudio to use the proper version of Git by doing the updating the preferences for ‘Git executable’:</p>

<p>RStudio can sync files with GitHub directly, and can be used instead of the GitHub App. Like the GitHub App, it will capture the changes made to any files within the repository, no matter which software was used to modify them. The advantage for using RStudio to sync instead of the GitHub App is if you are working with R scripts already. In RStudio, you sync by first pulling and then pushing (separately); in the GitHub App these two functions are done together.</p>
<p>Launch your project in RStudio by double-clicking the <code>.Rproj</code> file in the assessment folder on your local hard drive.</p>

<li><p><strong>draft</strong> branch is for editing. This is the default branch and the main working area where existing scenario data files can be edited and new scenarios added.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>published</strong> branch is a vetted copy of the draft branch, not for direct editing. This branch is only updated by automatic calculation of scores if:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>no errors occur during the calculation of scores in the draft branch, and</p></li>
<li><p>publishing is turned on. During the draft editing and testing phases of development, it is typically desirable to turn this off.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>gh-pages</strong> branch is this website. The results sections of the site (regions, layers, goals, scores per branch/scenario) are overwritten into this repository after automatic calculation of scores. The rest of the site can be manually altered.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>app</strong> branch is the interactive layer and map viewer application. The user interface and server-side processing use the <a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a> R package and are deployed online via <a href="https://www.shinyapps.io/">ShinyApps.io</a> to your website. Once deployed, the WebApp pulls updates from the data branches (draft and published) every time a new connection is initiated (i.e., browser refreshes).</p></li>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Using the Toolbox</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Section Summary:</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In this section, you will learn about the most common modifications made to repositories. You will be given examples to follow to help with your own assessment. The most common modifications are changing the pressures and resilience matrices, changing or creating data layers, and changing or removing goals models.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>TIP: You should now have your assessment repository opened and be familiar with the files in the folder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As your team finalizes which data should be included in the assessment and begins developing goal models, you can incorporate this information into your repository. Data layer files can be created and updated with any software that handles <em>.csv</em> files, but goal models must be updated in R. With any modifications you sync to the online repository, the Toolbox will automatically recalculate goal scores. Calculations can also be done locally and offline by running <code>subcountry2014/calculate_scores.R</code>.</p>
<p>This section gives instruction and examples for the most common modifications you will make to your repository:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>modifying pressures and resilience matrices</strong></li>
<li><strong>modifying and creating data layers for status, trend, pressures and resilience</strong></li>
<li><strong>modifying goal models</strong></li>
<li><strong>removing goals</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.0.1</span> File Preparation Workflow</h3>
<p>It is generally recommended that you construct a useful workflow with your team when updating data layers for the Toolbox. This process is one that can be done by one person, or by several who are working through GitHub to sync the work. There are overall two main steps to preparing to input your layers into the Toolbox, starting with data layer preparation, and then going into data layer registration. The firs step involves placing files into <code>layers</code> folder, and the second is registering those files in <code>layers.csv</code>. This file preparation process can occur in tandem with the model modification process. However, it must occur in order for you to run modified goal code using your new input data.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Modifying and creating data layers</h2>
<p>Data layers are <em>.csv</em> files and are located in the <code>[assessment]/subcountry2014/layers</code> folder. Remember that all data layers provided in your repository are extracted from the global 2014 assessment.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1ztC3Warw_qWkxJsbPFcdrKRqPBmG-EqYzxHCK6RUQ8I/pub?w=1150&amp;h=818" alt="This figure shows the location of your data layers. Mac navigation is shown above and Windows is shown below." />
<p class="caption">This figure shows the location of your data layers. Mac navigation is shown above and Windows is shown below.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Layers with the suffix <code>_gl2014.csv</code> (<em>gl</em> for <em>global</em>) have been exactly copied from the global assessment and applied equally to each region, and therefore the values will be the same across all subcountry regions.</li>
<li>Layers with the suffix <code>_sc2014.csv</code> (<em>sc</em> for <em>subcountry</em>) have been spatially-extracted from global data or adjusted with spatially-extracted data so that each region in your assessment has a unique value. For example, gross domestic product (GDP) used in the global assessment was reported at the national (most often country) level. Instead of being applied equally across all subcountry regions (which would incorrectly increase the nation’s GDP several times), national GDP was down-weighted by the proportion of coastal population in each region compared with the total coastal population.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both types of default data layers are of coarse-resolution and should be replaced with local, high-resolution data when possible. The priority should be to replace as much of the <code>_gl2014.csv</code> data as possible.</p>
<p><strong>There are several steps to follow when working with data layers:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Modify or create data layer with proper formatting</li>
<li>Save the layer in the <code>layers</code> folder</li>
<li>Register the layer in <code>layers.csv</code></li>
<li>Check (and update when appropriate) <code>pressures_matrix.csv</code> and <code>resilience_matrix.csv</code> (located in: <code>[assessment]/subcountry2014/conf</code>)</li>
</ol>
<div id="create-data-layers-with-proper-formatting" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.1</span> Create data layers with proper formatting</h3>
<p>The OHI Toolbox expects each data layer to be in its own <em>.csv</em> file and to be in a specific format, with data available for every region within the study area, with data organized in ‘long’ format (as few columns as possible), and with a unique region identifier (<em>rgn_id</em>) associated with a single score or value. See the <strong>‘Formatting data for the Toolbox’</strong> section for more information.</p>
</div>
<div id="save-data-layers-in-the-layers-folder" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.2</span> Save data layers in the <em>layers</em> folder</h3>
<p>When you modify existing or create new data layers, we recommend saving this as a new <em>.csv</em> file with a suffix identifying your assessment (example: <code>_sc2014.csv</code>). Modifying the layer name provides an easy way to track which data layers have been updated regionally, and which rely on global data. Then, the original layers (<code>_gl2014.csv</code> and <code>_sc2014.csv</code>) can be deleted.</p>
<p>* Note: filenames should not have any spaces: use an underscore (‘_’) instead. This will reduce problems when R reads the files.</p>
</div>
<div id="register-data-layers-in-layers.csv" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.3</span> Register data layers in <code>layers.csv</code></h3>
<p>When there are new filenames associated with each layer, they will need to be registered in <code>[assessment]/subcountry2014/layers.csv</code>. If a layer simply has a new filename, only the <em>filename</em> column needs to be updated:</p>
<div class="figure">

<blockquote>
<p>TIP: This part is done manually. If you prefer not to manipulate your file by hand, you can generate a script that automates this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, if a new layer has been added (for example when a new goal model is developed), you will need to add a new row in the registry for the new data layer and fill in the first eight columns (columns A-H); other columns are generated later by the Toolbox as it confirms data formatting and content:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>targets:</strong> Add the goal/dimension that the new data layer relates to. Goals are indicated with two-letter codes and sub-goals are indicated with three-letter codes, with pressures, resilience, and spatial layers indicated separately.</li>
<li><strong>layer:</strong> Add an identifying name for the new data layer, which will be used in R scripts like <code>functions.R</code> and <em>.csv</em> files like <code>pressures_matrix.csv</code> and <code>resilience_matrix.csv</code>.</li>
<li><strong>name:</strong> Add a longer title for the data layer–this will be displayed on your WebApp.</li>
<li><strong>description:</strong> Add a longer description of the new data layer–this will be displayed on your WebApp.</li>
<li><strong>fld_value:</strong> Add the appropriate units for the new data layer (which will be referenced in subsequent calculations).</li>
<li><strong>units:</strong> Add a description about the <em>units</em> chosen in the <em>fld_value</em> column above.</li>
<li><strong>filename:</strong> Add a filename for the new data layer that matches the name of the <em>.csv</em> file that was created previously in the <code>layers</code> folder.</li>
<li><strong>fld_id_num:</strong> Area designation that applies to the newly created data layer, such as: <em>rgn_id</em> and <em>fao_id</em>.</li>

<div id="check-pressures-and-resilience-matrices" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.4</span> Check pressures and resilience matrices</h3>

</div>
</div>
<div id="modifying-pressures-matrices" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Modifying pressures matrices</h2>
<p>Your team will identify if any pressures layers should be added to the pressures matrices, and if so, which goals the pressure affects and what weight they should have. You can transfer this information in <code>pressures_matrix.csv</code> (located in the <code>[assessment]/subcountry2014/conf</code> folder). It is important to note that the matrix identifies the pressures relevant to each goal, and which weight will be applied in the calculation. Each pressure is a data layer, located in the <code>subcountry2014/layers</code> folder. This means that pressure layers need information for each region in the study area, and some layers will need to be updated with local data. In modifying pressures, you will need to consider whether data layers can be updated or added, and whether data layers map onto goals appropriately in the local context.</p>
<p>Adding a new pressure to the pressures matrix requires the following steps:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create new pressure layer(s) and save in the <code>layers</code> folder</li>
<li>Register pressure layer(s) in <code>layers.csv</code></li>
<li>Register pressure layer(s) in <code>pressures_matrix.csv</code></li>
</ol>

<li><ol start="3" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Modify the resilience matrix (if necessary)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The following is an example of adding two new pressures layers.</p>
<div id="create-the-new-pressure-layers-and-save-in-the-layers-folder" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.1</span> Create the new pressure layers and save in the <code>layers</code> folder</h3>
<p>If you create a new data layer, give it a short but descriptive name that also includes a prefix that signifies the pressure category (for example: <em>po_</em> for the pollution category). There are five physical categories and one social category:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>po_</em> = pollution</li>
<li><em>hd_</em> = habitat destruction</li>
<li><em>fp_</em> = fishing pressure</li>
<li><em>sp_</em> = species pollution</li>
<li><em>cc_</em> = climate change</li>
<li><em>ss_</em> = social pressure</li>
</ul>
<p>So for example, <code>po_trash</code> is a pollution layer with trash on beaches, and <code>sp_alien</code> is species pollution due to alien (invasive) species.</p>
<p>In the current example, the two new layers created to account for the input and output effects of desalination operations will be called <em>po_desal_in</em>, and <em>po_desal_out</em>.</p>
<p>These new layers will have scores from 0 to 1, with values for each region in your study area, and will be saved in the <code>layers</code> folder.</p>

<p><code>pressures_matrix.csv</code> identifies the different types of ocean pressures (columns) with the goals that they affect (rows). Adding a new pressures layer to <code>pressures_matrix.csv</code> requires adding a new column with the pressure layer name.</p>
<div id="set-the-pressure-category" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.2.3.1</span> Set the pressure category</h4>
<p>This step requires transferring previous decisions made by your team into <code>pressures_matrix.csv</code>. Each pressure category is calculated separately before being combined with the others, so it is important to register the new pressure with the appropriate category prefix decided by your regional assessment team.</p>

<div id="identify-the-goals-affected-and-set-the-weighting" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.2.3.2</span> Identify the goals affected and set the weighting</h4>
<p>This step also requires transferring prior decisions into <code>pressures_matrix.csv</code>. Mark which goals are affected by this new pressure, and then set the weighting. Pressures weighting by goal should be based on scientific literature and expert opinion (3 = highly influential pressure, 2 = moderately influential pressure, 1 = not very influential pressure). Remember that the rankings in the pressures matrix are separate from the actual data within the pressures data layers. The rankings ensure that within a particular goal (e.g. within a row of the pressures matrix), the stressors that more strongly influence the goal’s delivery have a larger contribution to that goal’s overall pressure score. Therefore, the rankings are assigned independently of the actual pressure scores, and only determine their importance within the calculations.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.4</span> Modify the resilience matrix (if necessary)</h3>
<p>Resilience is included in OHI as the sum of the ecological factors and social initiatives (policies, laws, etc.) that can positively affect goal scores by reducing or eliminating pressures. The addition of new pressure layers may therefore warrant the addition of new resilience layers that were not previously relevant. Similarly, the removal of pressure layers may warrant the removal of now irrelevant resilience layers.</p>

<div id="modifying-resilience-matrices" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Modifying resilience matrices</h2>
<p>Previous decisions made with your team will identify if any resilience layers should be added to the resilience matrices, and if so, which goals and/or pressures the resilience affects and what weight they should have. You can then transfer this information into <code>resilience_matrix.csv</code> (located in the <code>[assessment]/subcountry2014/conf</code> folder).</p>
<p><code>resilience_matrix.csv</code> maps the different types of resilience (columns) with the goals that they affect (rows). New resilience layers may be added to <code>resilience_matrix.csv</code> based on finer-scale local information either in response to a new pressures layer, or as a new independent measure. Any added layer must be associated with a pressures layer that has a weight of 2 or 3 in the OHI framework so that resilience measures can mitigate pressures in each region.</p>
<p>Each goal must have a resilience measure associated with it. In the figure below, the Toolbox would give an error because there are no resilience layers indicated for the natural products (NP) goal.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.3.1</span> Updating resilience matrix with local habitat information</h3>
<p>In this example we will borrow from the experience of <code>ohi-israel</code>, where they assessed habitats in the Habitats (HAB) sub-goal that were not included in global assessments <code>ohi-global</code>. Therefore, the resilience matrix needed some revision.</p>
<p>The habitats assessed for <code>ohi-israel</code> are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>rocky_reef</code>, <code>sand_dunes</code>, <code>soft_bottom</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Updates are required for the following files:</p>

<li><em>resilience_matrix.csv</em></li>
<li><em>resilience_weights.csv</em> (only if adding new resilience layers)</li>
</ul>
<div id="global-resilience-layers" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.3.1.1</span> Global resilience layers</h4>
<p>The first step is to determine which resilience layers from the global assessment are relevant to your assessment, and whether others need to be added. The full list of layers included in the global resilience matrix are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>alien_species</code>, <code>cites</code>, <code>fishing_v1</code>, <code>fishing_v1_eez</code>, <code>fishing_v2_eez</code>, <code>fishing_v3</code>, <code>fishing_v3_eez</code>, <code>habitat</code>, <code>habitat_combo</code>, <code>habitat_combo_eez</code>, <code>li_gci</code>, <code>li_sector_evenness</code>, <code>mariculture</code>, <code>msi_gov</code>, <code>species_diversity</code>, <code>species_diversity_3nm</code>, <code>tourism</code>, <code>water</code>, <code>wgi_all</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of these layers capture general aspects of governance that apply to the protection of any habitat. These are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>alien_species</code>, <code>cites</code>, <code>msi_gov</code>, <code>water</code>, <code>wgi_all</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two layers only apply to the livelihoods and economies goal (LE), so they should be excluded from HAB resilience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>li_gci</code>, <code>li_sector_evenness</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The remaining layers apply to certain habitats, but not others. We focus on these to determine how to adapt the HAB resilience calculation for <code>ohi-israel</code>. They are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>fishing_v1</code>, <code>fishing_v1_eez</code>, <code>fishing_v2_eez</code>, <code>fishing_v3</code>, <code>fishing_v3_eez</code>, <code>habitat</code>, <code>habitat_combo</code>, <code>habitat_combo_eez</code>, <code>mariculture</code>, <code>species_diversity</code>, <code>species_diversity_3nm</code>, <code>tourism</code></p>

<p><strong>Questions to consider</strong>:</p>
<p>The first objective is to determine whether the general <code>fishing_v..</code> or <code>habitat_...</code> categories are relevant to each of the habitats. For example, fisheries regulations do not affect the conservation of sand dunes, so this habitat should not use any of the fisheries combos. If the general resilience categories are relevant to the habitat, the next step is to select one resilience layer within the <code>fishing_v…</code> and <code>habitat...</code> categories that most adequately captures the suite of combined resilience variables that affect the habitat. For example, the sand dune habitat is a strictly coastal habitat, so the most appropriate resilience layer would be the one that uses the MPA_coast (i.e., <code>habitat_combo</code>). The rocky reef and soft bottom, on the other hand, should definitely include fisheries and habitat regulations. So, you’ll need to choose a fisheries and a habitat combo for these two habitats. To do so, consider:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>For which habitats should you use both a fishery and a habitat combo, or just use a habitat combo?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>fisheries regulations do not affect the conservation of sand-dunes, so this habitat should not use any of the fisheries combos. Also, this is a strictly coastal habitat, so choose the habitat layer that uses the <code>MPA_coast</code> instead of the <code>MPA_eez</code>, i.e. <code>habitat_combo</code> (and, as mentioned above, choose the coastal version of biodiversity, i.e. <code>species_diversity_3nm</code>).</li>
<li>The rocky reef and soft bottom, on the other hand, should definitely include fisheries regulations. So you’ll need to choose a fisheries and a habitat combo for these two habitats.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Which fisheries and habitat combos for <code>rocky_reef</code> and <code>soft_bottom</code>? The choice depends on two things:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>whether they are coastal habitats (within 3nm of the coast) or EEZ-wide habitats
<ul>
<li>if coastal, use the fisheries and habitat combos with <code>MPA_coast</code> (<code>fishing_v1</code>, <code>fishing_v3</code>, <code>habitat_combo</code>), and the <code>species_diversity_3nm</code> layer</li>
<li>if EEZ-wide, use the fisheries and habitat combos with <code>MPA_eez</code> (<code>fishing_v1_eez</code>, <code>fishing_v2_eez</code>, <code>fishing_v3_eez</code>, <code>habitat_combo_eez</code>), and the <code>species_diversity</code> layer</li>
</ul></li>
<li>whether the fisheries occurring on that habitat are mainly artisanal, mainly commercial, or both
<ul>
<li>if only commercial fisheries, use a layer that only uses the <code>Mora</code> data <code>fishing_v1..</code>)</li>
<li>if only artisanal/small-scale fisheries, use a layer that only uses the <code>Mora_s4</code> data (<code>fishing_v3..</code>)</li>
<li>if both, use a layer that uses both <code>Mora</code> and <code>Mora_s4</code> data (<code>fishing_v2..</code>)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It may also be that the existing global combo layers are not appropriate for your habitats. For example, if rocky reef is mainly coastal, and it is fished by both commercial and artisanal methods, then we need a new combo that uses <code>Mora</code>, <code>Mora_s4</code>, <code>CBD_hab</code>, and <code>MPA_coast</code> (this is the same as <code>fishing_v2_eez</code>, but we use the <code>MPA_coast</code> layer instead of the <code>MPA_eez</code>). All other combinations are already present.</li>
<li><p>Another issue to consider is whether local data are available to improve the pressure layers (that are based on global data). For example, if there are local data on Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and any areas with special regulations, this should be used to generate the <code>MPA_coast</code> and <code>MPA_eez</code> layers.You may know that only certain types of protected areas are closed to fisheries, and may want to only include those. Also, local datasets may be more accurate and regularly updated. **NOTE: in the global study, these are the same datasets used to calculate the status of Lasting Special Places (LSP).</p></li>
<li>How to update <code>resilience_matrix.csv</code>?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>write the complete list of layers you want to use for each habitat. Based on the above, for example, <code>soft bottom</code> in Israel matches the combination of layers called <em>soft bottom, with corals</em> in the default <code>resilience_matrix.csv</code>. But the <code>rocky_reef</code> and <code>sand_dunes</code> don’t seem to match any existing combination, so you’ll probably need to delete some of the rows, e.g. the <em>coral only</em>, and replace with new ad-hoc rows.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.4</span> Modifying goal models</h2>
<p>When an existing layer is updated with new data, the Toolbox will automatically incorporate it into the goal calculations after the updated filenames are registered in <code>layers.csv</code>. However, if a new layer has been added to the layers folder and registered in <code>layers.csv</code>, the Toolbox will not use it unless it is called in a goal model. To integrate any new data layers registered in <code>layers.csv</code> you will need to modify the goal model to incorporate the data. Furthermore, in many cases, it will make sense to modify goal models based on data availability and/or local context. For example, the models for regional analyses can often be simplified because of improved data.</p>
<p><strong>There are two steps to follow when working with goal models:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Update <code>functions.R</code></li>
<li>Check and possibly update <code>goals.csv</code></li>
</ol>
<div id="update-functions.r" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.4.1</span> Update <em>functions.R</em></h3>
<p>To incorporate a new data layer into a goal model, open <code>functions.R</code> in RStudio: this script contains all the models for each goal and sub-goal. A member of your team with the ability to write R code will need to translate the updated goal model into the Toolbox format. Follow the structure of existing goal models in order to incorporate the new data layers, noting the use of certain R packages for data manipulation.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.4.4.1</span> <strong>Natural Products</strong></h4>
<p>You may have already looked at the <strong>NP</strong> section of <code>functions.R</code>. In simple terms, here is what the code is doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>It pulls out the appropriate data layers to find out the amount of each product per unit area. It does gap-filling as necessary for the Global data.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<!---Alt text--->
<p>It should be noted that in the Global Assessments, the harvested amounts are derived from the information from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and these are combined with habitat values used elsewhere in the assessment. You should be conscious of this as you go through the model and change it, because you may be able to simplify aspects of the code such as gap-filling.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>It calculates Exposure by finding how intensely each identified product is being harvested (amount of product per km^2), and then transforms this from a scale from 0 to 1.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>TIP: The data layer, <code>hab_extent</code> is used here and in other goal models in the default code for the Global Assessment.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>In parallel to this, it finds the Risk of each product based on a scoring system that becomes binary: 0, or 1.</p></li>
<li><p>It then averages the two factors, Exposure and Risk, to reveal where risk and intensity are highest. This value is then inverted to become Sustainability and to reward lower intensity and lower risk.</p></li>
<li><p>The amount of each kind of product, relative to the peak historical yield of that product across all regions assessed, and Sustainability are both used create sustainability-weighted scores for all regions and all years available.</p></li>

<p>If the case is that corals, sponges, and then you might be able to use FAO data, which is the data source of the Global Assessments. Otherwise, you will have to find comparable data in your area or consult local statistical offices and local fisheries managers to get harvest values similar to landing values and any other kinds of stock assessments. The IUCN offers quantified assessments of risk to species, but that is more appropriate for biodiversity; CITES signatory data may be more appropriate for the trade products. Exposure can be calculated spatially, and for this you should be able to find or produce your own maps if possible. Your maps might have finer resolution than those in global resolution.</p>

<p>TIP: When checking your data, check cases where country-product pair has 0 for sustainability score, but relatively high harvest ratio (curr harvest/peak harvest) – it may be a flag that the sustainability score is off (eg because the habitat area is off)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>TIP: Explore simplifying gap-filling: use correlation model of dollar value vs. harvested tonnage, while discarding the part of script using dollar ratio (current dollar value)/(peak dollar value) as a gap-filler for harvest ratio.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>TIP: Switch the gap-filling order: using the dollar value correlation model first (in cases where the most recent year has no harvest reported but has dollar value reported, that’s a better estimate than using the harvest from the previous year), then gap-fill any remaining cases of missing harvest for the current year with harvest from the previous year</p>

<div id="notes-tech-specs" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.5.0.1</span> Notes: Tech Specs</h4>
<!---Note on Updating the Script: I just pushed a new script, `data_prep_2015a.R`, and the resulting outputs to `ohiprep/globalprep/fao_commodities/v2015`.  The new script reworks the gap-filling, based on Mel's and Katie's suggestions.  I'll post later about the smoothing and calculations based on new input from Katie, but would love to get input on the gap-filling first.
* Before gap-filling, binds the USD and tonnes data for all natural products at the commodity level (rather than product level).
* By commodity & year: Identifies years with neither USD nor tonnes data, flags as `no_data`, and determines first reporting year based on first year with either data (and deletes years prior to this).
* By commodity & year: Gap-fills according to these rules:
    * If `no_data`, and not the last year of data set, assume that non-reporting means zero harvest; replace `NA` with `0` for both USD and tonnes
    * Create regression models for `(tonnes ~ USD)` and `(USD ~ tonnes)`
        * Exclude NAs (these will be in either USD or tonnes, but not both)
        * Remove all commodities with fewer than four non-zero observations (within a particular region)
            * not enough info for a decent regression or meaningful peak
            * counting these could also penalize experimental production that later stops
        * Use `lm()` to generate slope/intercept, and gap-fill all NAs with the appropriate regression model
        * Regression gap-filling takes care of the most current-year gaps, per Katie's comment
        * Regression gap-filling fails for certain data, where there are no paired observations for correlation (e.g. every reported value for USD shows NA for tonnes, and/or vice versa), still need to figure out how to deal with those without losing useful data.
    * If `no_data` appears in most recent year of data set, not applicable for regression gap-fill, so end-fill based upon the prior year.
    * Outputs a .csv with rgn_id, commodity, product, year, and gapfill method at the commodity level.  I made up text codes for now, pretty self-explanatory, but those are easy to change.  File is `data/np_gapfill_report.csv` if you want to take a peek.
* Collapses commodities into products at this point, in preparation for smoothing, finding peaks, and determining status and weighting.

Latest on NP:
in ohiprep/globalprep/FAO-commodities, new (well, a week or so ago) data_prep2015.R that fixes:
* the FAO data cleaning, so treats '0 0' as 0.1 instead of NA
* gap filling:
    * it runs at commodity level instead of product level
    * gapfills between USD and tonnes in sequence: local regression, then georegional regression, then global regression.
    * does all that before end-filling.
    * produces a gapfilling report for every commodity/region/year.
Currently this outputs a single file; needs to be updated to output individual files for tonnes, tonnes_rel, and prod_weight.  Needs to be renamed to data_prep.R.

In ohi-global/eez2013, LSP_update branch, I've updated /conf/functions.R - cleaned up (dplyr, etc), chunked into sub-functions.  Questions that need to be addressed:
* currently calcs trend using last five years of data (year_max >= year > year_max-5), which means only four intervals for the regression.  I think we want to include the (year_max - 5) data, for five intervals, so: (year_max >= year >= year_max-5).
* currently, for regions with exposure = NA, replaces NAs with zero.  Should these be replaced with one instead?
    * Exposure for these indicates harvest intensity (tonnes/km^2) relative to the region with the max harvest intensity.
    * NAs occur when a country hasn't reported area values for rocky (seaweeds), coral (corals), so tonnes/NA = NA.
    * Setting exposure to zero means intensity = none at all (boosting the status); leaving as NA removes from calculation (ignored in status); setting to one means intensity = worst case (penalizing the status).--->
<pre><code>&lt;!---Note Ecuador&#39;s approach to Natural Products:
Very low data for species, so it has been hard to advance this goal, unknown for each global product. but they did look up FAO data and found 3 products by country
but they need to be looking for data for things they actually produce, like madera, leña de manglares, sea horses, they do have data for ornamental species in Sta Elena (not sure if they have data (tonnes) of catch of these species) they have good resilience measures, should add these Maybe they should ignore this goal all together? → they can decide to, but first I think they should think about what natural products are actually important to the area: we’ve heard about mangrove wood before---&gt;</code></pre>

<div id="modifying-goals-with-categories" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.7</span> Modifying goals with categories</h2>
<p>Several goals have categories that are assessed within them. In global assessments, these goals are:</p>
<table>

<p>These goal categories are identified in the file <code>config.r</code> located in the <code>conf</code> folder. The Toolbox uses <code>config.r</code> to identify the appropriate categories when pressures and resilience dimensions are calculated.</p>
<p>When you open <code>config.r</code>, you’ll see that the <code>pressures_components</code> variable identifies which data layer indicates the category types. For global assessments, the following data layers are used:</p>

<p>If you have modified any of the categories for any goal, you will likely need to update the layer indicated in <code>config.r</code> in addition to updating the categories as unique rows in <code>pressures_matrix.csv</code>.</p>
<div id="example-1-pressures" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.7.1</span> Example 1: Pressures</h3>
<p>For example, there are three product types for Natural Products in the China assessment (seasalt, sea chemicals, and sea medicine), differ from those assessed in the global assessments (corals, fish_oil, ornamentals, seaweeds, sponges). To modify this goal in the Toolbox, input layers were updated, saved in the <code>layers</code> folder, and registered in <code>layers.csv</code>; the NP function in <code>functions.r</code> was updated, and new categories replaced the old in <code>pressures_matrix.csv</code>. The only remaining step to finalize the new NP goal is to update <code>config.r</code> to ensure it looks for the correct data layer and therefore categories. If you do not update <code>config.r</code> before running <code>calculate_scores.r</code>, you will get the following warning:</p>
<pre><code>Calculating Pressures...
The following components for NP are not in the
aggregation layer np_harvest_product_weight categories
(corals, fish_oil, ornamentals, seaweeds, sponges):
seasalt, sea_chemicals, sea_medicine</code></pre>
<p>This message indicates that the <code>np_harvest_product_weight</code> layer identifies five categories (corals, fish_oil, ornamentals, seaweeds, sponges) but the <code>pressures_matrix.csv</code> indicates three (seasalt, sea_chemicals, sea_medicine).</p>
<p>To ensure that pressures are calculated correctly for the categories in your assessment, you will need to change the layer identified in <code>config.r</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="example-2-pressures" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.7.2</span> Example 2: Pressures</h3>
<p>More subtle examples of these mismatch between the categories identified in <code>pressures_matrix.csv</code> and <code>config.r</code> can also occur. For example, after updating the CS layers and goal in the China assessment, the following warning message appeared when running <code>calculate_scores.r</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Calculating Pressures...
The following components for CS are not in the aggregation layer
cs_extent categories (saltmarshes, seagrasses, mangroves):
mangrove, saltmarsh, seagrass</code></pre>
<p>The problem here is that the categories identified in <code>config.r</code> (saltmarshes, seagrasses, mangroves) are plural, whereas the categories identified in the pressures matrix (mangrove, saltmarsh, seagrass) are singular, and the Toolbox needs exact matches. To fix this warning, you need to update the pressures matrix with the plural names.</p>
</div>
<div id="example-3-resilience" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.7.3</span> Example 3: Resilience</h3>
<p>For resilience, the proper categories also need to be identified both in <code>resilience_matrix.csv</code> and <code>config.r</code>. If neither are updated, you will see the following message:</p>
<pre><code>Calculating Resilience...
Note: each goal in resilience_matrix.csv
must have at least one resilience field
Based on the following components for NP:
corals
fish_oil
ornamentals
seaweeds
shells
sponges</code></pre>
<p>With resilience, if we update only the <code>resilience_matrix.csv</code> but not <code>config.r</code>, we get the following error message instead of the warning message we saw for pressures above.</p>
<pre><code>Based on the following components for NP:
  seasalt
  sea_chemicals
  sea_medicine
Error in subset.default(SelectLayersData(layers, layers = lyrs),
id_num ==  : object &#39;id_num&#39; not found
In addition: Warning messages:
1: Grouping rowwise data frame strips rowwise nature
2: In left_join_impl(x, y, by$x, by$y) :

  ```

This error can be fixed by updating `config.r` with a layer identifying the appropriate categories. NOTE: the file identified in `config.r` cannot contain any NA values.

### Preparing the fisheries sub-goal 

Here is some background information about how to prepare fisheries data layers for the Toolbox.

**Data layers used by the Toolbox:**

* `fis_b_bmsy`
* `fis_meancatch`

#### Description of data layers

`fis_b_bmsy`

* *for species*: B/Bmsy estimate (either from formal stock assessment, or from a data-poor method such as CMSY)    
* *for genus/family/broader taxa*: the toolbox will use median B/Bmsy from species in that region + a penalty for not reporting at species level. In order for the code to assign the correct penalty, the taxa need to include a numerical code of 6 digits, where the first digit behaves like an ISSCAAP code (the standardized species codes used by FAO): 6 means species, 5 means genus, 4 to 1 are increasingly broad taxonomic groups    
* *data source (for CMSY)*: catch time-series (at least 10 years of catch &gt;0), species resilience (if available)  

**Example data:**

|fao_id |taxon_name     |year |b_bmsy   |
|:------|:--------------|:----|:--------|
|51     |Ablennes hians |1985 |1.112412 |
|51     |Ablennes hians |1986 |1.222996 |
|51     |Ablennes hians |1987 |1.371058 |


NOTE: if a species that is caught in different sub-regions belongs to the same population, you don&#39;t want to split the catch among sub-regions, instead, you want to sum catch across all sub-regions, so you can calculate B/Bmsy for the whole population. For the global analysis we grouped all species catch by FAO major fishing area (www.fao.org/fishery/area/search/en), indicated in the column *fao_id*, assuming that all species caught within the same FAO area belonged to the same stock, while we assumed that the same species, if caught in a different fishing area, belonged to a separate stock.  
Use *fao_id* as an identifier that separates different fisheries &#39;stocks&#39; belonging to the same species.   
If you don&#39;t have multiple stocks in your study area, set all *fao_id* = 1.  

`fis_meancatch`:

* average catch across all years, per species, per region  
* *data source*: catch time-series (at least 10 years of catch &gt;0), with a unique identifier for each population that you want to assess separately   
 
**Example data:**

|fao_saup_id |taxon_name_key             |year |mean_catch  |
|:-----------|:--------------------------|:----|:-----------|
|37_8        |Aristeus antennatus_690051 |2014 |14.24398116 |
|37_8        |Atherinidae_400218         |2014 |27.30120156 |
|37_8        |Balistes capriscus_607327  |2014 |3.247883895 |

The *taxon_name_key* column indicates the name of the species (e.g. Aristeus antennatus) and its &#39;taxonkey&#39;. The taxonkey is a 6 digit numeric code used by the Sea Around Us Project, modified from FAO codes. The important element of this code is the first digit, because it reflects the taxonomic level (6=species, 5=genus, 4=family, etc.) of the reported catch.The toolbox uses this first digit to assign a score to all catch that was not reported at species level, taking the median of the B/Bmsy of assessed species, and adding a penalty that is increasingly strong for coarser taxa.    

`fis_proparea_saup2rgn`:  

* a conversion file that, for each region for which catch is reported, tells us what proportion of that region falls within each of the final OHI reporting regions.   

**Example data:**

| saup_id| rgn_id| prop_area|
|-------:|------:|---------:|
|     166|      1|       1.0|
|     162|      2|       1.0|
|     574|      3|       0.7|
|      37|      4|       0.8|

**Specific instances:**

 *only if catch is reported for different regions than the ones used for the OHI assessment:* this should be calculated using spatial analyses of overlap of the spatial units at which catch is reported with the spatial units at which the OHI assessment will be reported. The global data was reported by subregions (*saup_id*) and in some cases multiple subregions were part of the same, larger EEZ. Since for OHI we wanted results by EEZ (*rgn_id*), in those cases we needed to combine results from the subregions to get the final score, based on their size relative to the total EEZ size (*prop_area*).   
 *If catch is reported for the same areas for which OHI is calculated:* then all the *prop_area* are = 1.   
 *If catch is reported for the whole area of the assessment, but you want to calculate a separate OHI score for different sub-regions:* for each OHI reporting region (*rgn_id*) you&#39;ll repeat the same region in the *saup_id* column, and *prop_area* will be =1. This effectively means all the reporting regions will get assigned 100% of the catch and will have the same final stastus and trend score for the fisheries goal (but may have different pressures and resilience scores, if those layers are different in each sub-region).  

`fp_wildcaught_weight`: 

*only needed if there is mariculture*: for each region, this represents the relative proportion of catch coming from wild caught fisheries versus mariculture. The layer is used to weight how much the fisheries score influences the final food provision score, the higher the fisheries catch, the more the food provision score will reflect the fisheries score, and vice-versa if mariculture has a higher catch.       
(NOTE that, before all mariculture harvest from all species gets summed, the mariculture harvest for each species is smoothed and then multiplied by the resilience score).     

#### Running CMSY model

**Sample data to run CMSY:**

|id |stock_id                    |res    |ct          |yr   |
|:--|:---------------------------|:------|:-----------|:----|
|6  |Acanthistius brasilianus_41 |Medium |100         |1950 |
|23 |Acanthurus dussumieri_61    |       |0.059250269 |1950 |
|24 |Acanthurus dussumieri_71    |       |0.190749971 |1950 |
|25 |Acanthurus lineatus_61      |Low    |12.74821966 |1950 |

The current CMSY script produces an output that looks something like this (split into 2 tables): 

|stock_id          |convergence |effective_sample_size |yr   |b_bmsy   |b_bmsyUpper |
|:-----------------|:-----------|:---------------------|:----|:--------|:-----------|
|Ablennes hians_51 |SC          |30974                 |1985 |1.112412 |1.8         |
|Ablennes hians_51 |SC          |30974                 |1986 |1.222996 |1.768895    |

|stock_id          |yr   |b_bmsyLower |b_bmsyiq25 |b_bmsyiq75 |b_bmsyGM |b_bmsyMed |
|:-----------------|:----|:-----------|:----------|:----------|:--------|:---------|
|Ablennes hians_51 |1985 |1           |1          |1          |1.093932 |1         |
|Ablennes hians_51 |1986 |1.014688    |1.075699   |1.298437   |1.209005 |1.160329  |

where *stock_id* is the unique identifier for each stock that was used in the input file, *convergence* indicates whether the model converged and how strongly (&#39;SC&#39; = strong convergence), *effective_sample_size* reports the number of iterations used, *yr* = year, b_bmsy = B/Bmsy for the corresponding year (based on the median of all the estimated values: reccomended),  b_bmsyUpper = B/Bmsy at the upper 95% bootstrapped confidence bound, b_bmsyLower = B/Bmsy at the lower 95% bootstrapped confidence bound, b_bmsyiq25 = B/Bmsy at the first quartile, b_bmsyiq75 = B/Bmsy at the third quartile, b_bmsyGM = B/Bmsy based on the geometric mean of estimates, b_bmsyMed = B/Bmsy based on the median of estimates.

**How to:** 

**1. Include resilience in the CMSY code:**

In the CMSY R script, in the PARAMETERS section, replace the following:

&gt; ![](./fig/include_resilience.png)

**2. Make assumptions about fisheries regulations:**

If you assume that fisheries are depleted and there isn&#39;t very much fisheries regulation, and you are using the CMSY method to assess B/Bmsy, the original model may work well. If, however, the catch of a species declined because fisheries regulations have closed or limited the fishery, or if a fishery was abandoned for economic reasons (e.g., change in consumer prefereces, market price dynamics, etc.), the model may be too pessimistic and understimate B/Bmsy. In that case it may be best to use a version with a uniform prior on final biomass, instead of the constrained prior.  
The original constrained prior on final biomass is set by this line within the code:  
  </code></pre>
<p>finalbio &lt;- if(ct[nyr]/max(ct) &gt; 0.5) {c(0.3,0.7)} else {c(0.01,0.4)}</p>
<pre><code>
The model uses a uniform prior if that line is replaced with:
</code></pre>
<p>finalbio &lt;- c(0.01,0.7) ```</p>
<p><strong>3. Use data at a different spatial resolution than the final assessment:</strong></p>
<p>See notes above for <code>fis_proparea_saup2rgn</code></p>
<p><strong>4. Calculate B, or Bmsy:</strong></p>
<p>The CMSY model calculates B/Bmsy as a ratio, it does not estimate the two variables separately.</p>
<p><strong>5. Use catch per unit of effort (CPUE):</strong></p>
<p>The CMSY model requires total biomass removed by fisheries, and uses catch as a proxy for that. It cannot use CPUE. Other more sophisticated stock assessment models use CPUE and may be employed. We do not provide documentation for the use of these other models.</p>
<p><strong>6. Use other life-history characteristics, in addition to resilience:</strong></p>
<p>The CMSY model does not use more detailed information. Other more sophisticated stock assessment models use other life-history traits such as fecundity, larval dispersal, r, K, Lmax, etc., and may be employed. We do not provide documentation for the use of these other models.</p>
<p><strong>7. Create a ‘taxonkey’ to assign to each species:</strong></p>
<p>When replacing the SAUP_FAO data with your own data, assign a key of 600000 to all species. For all catch that is reported at genus or coarser taxonomic level, you will have to choose an appropriate taxonkey. You can create your own key, from 100000 to 500000, based on your own judgment of how many species may be reported under that same denomination, and how different they may be (all that matters for the toolbox code is whether the number starts with a 1,2,3,4,5 or 6 with 1 being the coarsest, such as ‘miscellaneous marine animals’, or ‘crustaceans nei’).</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">7</span> Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h1>
<p>This document provides answers to some frequently asked questions about conducting regional assessments using the Ocean Health Index. A few questions are related to general concepts in the Ocean Health Index, but mostly those topics are covered at <a href="http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/About/FAQ/" class="uri">http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/About/FAQ/</a>. Here, the FAQ are primarily technical questions regarding regional assessments and using the OHI Toolbox. This document will be updated continually as we have more questions. Questions are arranged by theme, and have the format Q: (question) and A: (answer).</p>
<div id="overall" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Overall</h2>

<div id="conceptual" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Conceptual</h2>
<p><strong>Q: Are regional assessment scores comparable with global assessment scores?</strong></p>
<p>A: Regional Index scores cannot be directly compared to global Index scores, or to other regional Index scores calculated through separate efforts. This is because data and indicators (both what they measure and their quality), reference points (set using local knowledge and priorities), and specific goal models are often different for the areas being compared.</p>
<p>However, because scores for each goal are scaled to a reference point, qualitative comparisons can be made. For example, a score of 71 in the US West Coast compared to 66 in Brazil says that the US West coast is closer to fully meeting its sustainable goals (i.e., meeting regional reference points). Furthermore, use of the same Ocean Health Index framework across regional assessments permits fruitful discussion and general comparisons even if data inputs differ. Ocean Health Index assessments at any scale always work within a standardized definition of ocean health, using information to capture the philosophy of the ten goals that have been identified (and undergone scientific peer-review) prior to compiling relevant data. Use of the ten-goal framework is important both to ensure that all aspects of ocean health are captured and to allow better comparison across regional assessments than would be possible if the different regions used different methods.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How does the Index account for ecosystem benefits?</strong></p>
<p>A: The OHI is not an index of ecosystem services. The Index prefers to describe benefits from a healthy ocean and emphasize their relevance, but the ideas are closely related. The ten goals roughly fall into areas of ecosystem services such as food provisioning (<strong>Food Provision</strong>), regulatory services (<strong>Carbon Storage</strong>), cultural services (<strong>Tourism and Recreation</strong>,<strong>Special Places</strong>), supporting services (<strong>Clean Waters</strong>, <strong>Biodiversity</strong>), and other values (<strong>Livelhoods and Economies</strong>).</p>
<p><em>(Source: OHI Baltic workshop)</em></p>
<p><strong>Q: Where is climate change measured in the Index?</strong></p>
<p>A: Four different aspects of climate change – increases in sea surface temperature (SST), sea level rise (SLR), ultraviolet radiation (UV), and ocean acidification (OA) – are included as pressures to many goals in the Index, including Natural Products, Carbon Storage, Coastal Protection, Sense of Place, Livelihoods &amp; Economies and Biodiversity. Mitigation of climate change through carbon storage is one of the ten goals.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why are food provision and artisanal fishing opportunities goals separated?</strong></p>
<p>A: These goals measure different aspects of how people relate to fishing. The catch of fish made by artisanal (=small-scale, subsistence type) fisheries is captured in the food provision goal. Jobs, wages and income from both the food provision and artisanal fishing goals are captured in the livelihoods &amp; economies goal. The purpose of the artisanal fishing opportunity goal is to evaluate the opportunity for people to pursue this fishing in relation to their need to do so.</p>

<div id="timing-and-resources" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.3</span> Timing and Resources</h2>
<p><strong>Q: How much does it cost to produce a regional assessment?</strong></p>
<p>A: Regional assessments can be completed at(varying costs depending on the local context.(Funds are needed for a management and scientific team, workshops and meetings (including travel), communications, policy engagement, and operating costs. Therefore, securing funding is an important component to satisfactorily complete the assessment. We encourage the development of a local proposal or strategic action plan that details a timeline of activities and the resources needed to accomplish them.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How many people are required in a team?</strong></p>
<p>A: rather than a specific number of individuals, what is required are specific skillsets. For example, if the scientific analysts were capable of effectively conducting the R analysis, then a dedicated R analyst would not be required. In current assessments, teams range between 2 and 8 people.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How long does it take to calculate OHI at a regional scale?</strong></p>
<p>A: The duration of an OHI assessment depends on a number of factors, such as the budget and number of people involved, the scale of the study area and whether new regions will need to be created, how easily data can be acquired, how much local data can be incorporated, how many goal models need to be changed. Additionally, decisions about setting reference points require input from experts. For independent assessments (OHI+), we have found that the average time has ranged from 1.5 to 3 years (See <strong>Task Timeline</strong> in the <strong>Conceptual Guide</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Q: How much time will modifications by an R analyst take?</strong></p>
<p>A: This will depend on if you are changing any models, and potentially data layers–but a lot of changing data layers just requires registering them properly in <code>layers.csv</code> (and maybe <code>pressures_matrix.csv</code> and resilience_matrix.csv if they are pressures or resilience files) and having the <code>functions.R</code> file call those layers. That is more ‘bookkeeping’ than actual R programming.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How much time will modifications by a GIS analyst take?</strong></p>
<p>A: this will depend on how many layers you are processing: you are clipping spatial data? That will take some time because there are quite a few files, but maybe not too long since it is pretty small scale and once there is a clipping mask created I think you apply it to other files.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Which goals require a GIS analyst?</strong></p>
<p>A: All goals using spatial data could potentially require a GIS analyst. These goals are commonly: habitat-based goals and sub-goals: (Coastal Protection, Carbon Storage, Habitats—a sub-goal of Biodiversity), Food Provision, Sense of Place, Species—a sub-goal of Biodiversity, Clean Waters</p>
</div>
<div id="structure" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.4</span> Structure</h2>
<p><strong>Q: Can we remove or add goals to the OHI?</strong></p>
<p>A: A lot of deliberation went into defining the ten goals, and they seem to do a pretty good job of covering many if not most ocean uses, so additional goals may not be necessary. But it could be that they eclipse or replace an existing goal.</p>
</div>
<div id="reference-points-1" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.5</span> Reference points</h2>
<p><strong>Q: Can planning targets can be used as the reference points?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, planning targets can be used as reference points. This won’t be appropriate for every goal, but there are cases where this seemed best (example: iconic species sub-goal in the global assessment, mariculture sub-goal in the US West Coast assessment).</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is sector evenness?</strong></p>
<p>A: Sector evenness (also called a diversity index) is an economic concept that is included in OHI to enable comparison across many different sectors included in the Livelihoods &amp; Economies goal. This goal evaluates jobs, wages and revenues for nine marine employment sectors. The distribution of employment across these nine sectors is an effective indicator of resilience. If total employment within a community is primarily based in one or two sectors, the overall economic system will be excessively vulnerable to downturns in those sectors. Conversely, if employment is spread relatively evenly throughout all nine sectors, the overall system will be more robust and resistant to such disturbances. Overall revenue within the community will remain more stable during such downturns, and workers displaced by a downturn in their sector may be able to find employment in another sector without leaving the community.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.6</span> Appropriate data layers</h2>
<p><strong>Q: Shipping and port activity are hardly affected by the health of the ecosystem. Why are these included in the Index?</strong></p>
<p>A: Shipping and port activity are included as pressures only</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can oil spills be included in OHI?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, oil spills could be included as a pressure and in the Clean Waters goal.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is seasonal (non-permanent) sea ice included in OHI habitats?</strong></p>
<p>A: No, sea ice only includes permanent sea ice.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can seaweeds be included in the Carbon Storage goal?</strong></p>
<p>A: Because they store carbon for less than 100 years, seaweeds and corals are not included in the carbon storage goal. While the pelagic oceanic carbon sink (phytoplankton) plays a large role in the sequestration of anthropogenic carbon, the pelagic ocean mechanisms are not amenable to local or regional management intervention. Phytoplankton and contribute to carbon fixation when they die and sink to the sea bottom at sufficient depth, because it is effectively out of circulation. However, if those phytoplankton are eaten, the carbon is cycled back into the system and not sequestered. Something that could potentially be included in the carbon storage goal is mollusc shells, if they are added to a landfill and not recycled in the sea. So if information on mariculture production and waste disposal are available, this could be an interesting addition to carbon storage at a regional scale.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is coastal engineering included in Coastal Protection? What if it reduces erosion?</strong></p>
<p>A: We did not include an assessment of the protection afforded by man-made structures, such as jetties and seawalls, because these structures cannot be preserved without maintenance, may have other negative side effects (e.g. alter sedimentation rates causing erosion in new locations), thus they do not constitute long-term sustainable services. Coastal engineering (jetties, harbours, marina and breakwater) is not natural, and is mostly seen as a pressure. It will also be evident in the status of due to decreased natural habitat. It gets tricky when structures are built to help reduce coastal erosion–they are still manmade and therefore not a natural benefit that the ocean provides. But if available data allow, it might be possible to include tradeoff effects: maybe in areas where natural habitats are degraded and man-made structures have been built to reduce erosion, we could reduce the pressure that would otherwise be applied.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How is seawater used for cooling on-shore power plants incorporated into OHI?</strong></p>
<p>A: The use of cooling water for on-shore power plants would be a pressure on the ocean, since it causes entrapment of fishes, larvae, etc, and usually is circulated back into the ocean at higher temperatures (and maybe other chemicals, minerals, etc). Since the energy is coming from land-based activities, there isn’t a service that the ocean is providing that ‘benefits’ people, it is only a pressure from the OHI perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How is freshwater production through desalination incorporated into OHI?</strong></p>
<p>A: Desal would be incorporated into OHI in several places. The benefit is that there is freshwater produced, which could be incorporated into the Natural Products goal (or potentially into its own goal). Data required would be the volume of freshwater created based on the volume of seawater involved and spatial extent. Setting the reference point would not be based on how much can be produced, but some other targets perhaps set by government (percentage of the population served). Similar to the mariculture sub-goal and tourism goals, any negative effects caused by desal that affect other goals (example: species) do not influence the ability to obtain desalination targets now and in the future. Therefore, the sustainability coefficient only measures the ability to sustain that goal, but not the impacts on other goals: instead, they are taken into account as pressures when calculating the other goals. Desal should be included as a pressure similar to cooling on-shore power plants since the discharge brine is dense, doesn’t plume very well and there are chemicals involved.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Where do energy activities fit in to OHI?</strong></p>
<p>It depends. Energy could be part of a <strong>Natural Products</strong> goal, for instance, such as wave energy – but then the question is, what is the reference point? It is partially accounted for in <strong>Livelihoods &amp; Economies</strong> through sectoral jobs data. The infrastructure is also something to consider. It could also be a pressure or resilience factor if there is a measurable footprint of the activity. You may want to consider for resilience, do you have governance measures that promote more sustainable practices in the energy industry?</p>

<div id="food-provision" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.7</span> Food Provision</h2>
<p><strong>Q: Could the culture of marine fish in closed pools on-shore be included in the Mariculture sub-goal?</strong></p>
<p>A: This should not be included because onshore aquaculture does not require a marine environment.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can aquaculture farms that receive seawater supply and return seawater back to the sea be included in the food provision goal?</strong></p>
<p>A: This would be more appropriately included in the Mariculture sub-goal, and with finer-scale data additional pressures due to the intake pipes and the processed brine back into the marine system could be incorporated as well. Natural Products</p>
<p><strong>Q: If natural products are all produced through on-land aquaculture, should this goal be removed?</strong></p>
<p>A: In this case you would probably have good reason to exclude the natural product goal due if this was defendable through discussions with experts and any reports/papers on the topic. This would also depend on the origin of these natural products–are they from the region’s waters? Habitat-based goals</p>
<p>**Q: I have fish that are used as feed for other fish (e.g., sprat) in my country. Can I include them in this goal?</p>
<p>A: It would be more appropriate to include them in Natural Products rather than Food Provision. This is because they are not being consumed directly. Fish such as sprat, for example, may be used to feed pigs in addition to other fish, and therefore you would need to know how much (tonnage) is being produced, and where it is going to be able to accurately distinguish these categories to avoid double-counting.</p>
<p><em>(Source: OHI Baltic Workshop, February 2015)</em></p>
<p><strong>Q: How is coral health calculated?</strong></p>
<p>A: Coral health was estimated by compiling point data from multiple studies of percent live coral cover. In other words, estimates of coral cover within transects of certain sites were repeated in time and we used that rate of change in time as an indication of health of the reefs in the whole region. The difficulty lies in 1) having enough different locations sampled that you can say something about the whole region and 2) finding studies that did repeated measures in time, in the same location, over at least 20 years. In the Global 2013 assessment, there were so few datasets that satisfied this condition that we had to pool observations from different locations.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is it possible to calculate habitat goals when there is only one year of habitat data?</strong></p>
<p>A: With only one year of habitat data, it is not possible to calculate the trend (which requires 5 years of data). Instead, it might be best to use the available habitat data to calculate the current status and then to overlay pressures for the last 5 years to calculate trend.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Benefits gained from Wild-caught fisheries, Mariculture, Tourism &amp; Recreation are included in specific goals. Why are these counted again in Livelihoods &amp; Economies?</strong></p>
<p>A: The quantity of fish, mariculature, and participation in T&amp;R are considered separately in goals whereas the monetary component is captured in L&amp;E.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why are revenue data from shipping, boat building, ports and harbors included as revenue? Do these activities rely on a healthy ocean?</strong></p>
<p>A: These sectors are included in the Ocean Health Index because the demand for some of those boats (fishing boats, sailboats, yachts) is dependent on a healthy ocean.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why isn’t oil and gas industries included in revenue?</strong></p>
<p>A: The Natural Products goal does not include non-living items such as oil, gas, and mining products, because these practices are not considered to be sustainable. They are also done at such large scales that including them would essentially make OHI an index for oil and mining–and they are not truly an ocean product. Because these products are not included in terms of quantity extracted, it did not seem appropriate to include information regarding jobs, wages or revenue.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.9</span> Tourism &amp; Recreation</h2>
<p><strong>Q: How do I calculate the sustainability term for TR?</strong></p>
<p>A: The best way is to use a local indicator or measure of tourism sustainability or competitiveness, otherwise use the TTCI value from the Global 2013 assessment for the study area (applied evenly across all regions.</p>

<div id="natural-products-1" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.10</span> Natural Products</h2>
<p><strong>Q: Where do Natural Products come from?</strong></p>
<p>A: In the global assessments, Natural Products data come from the UN’s Food and Agriculture Administration (www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/software/fishstatj/en). These data are compiled and reported by product for each country, and available by downloading the FishStatJ software.</p>

<div id="species" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.11</span> Species</h2>
<p><strong>Q: Can species and iconic species model scores be penalized if there are local flagship species that have not been evaluated?</strong></p>
<p>Global data are based on IUCN assessments. For these evaluations, IUCN chooses a taxon (e.g. sharks) and a group of world experts assess it comprehensively. Locally identified species identified in a regional assessment may not be in the IUCN database because they do not belong to one of the taxa that have been selected for assessment, or because the experts that did the assessment did not know that information existed. In either case, there is no connection between what IUCN reports and what assessments are done locally. Therefore, it might not be fair to penalize a study area for missing species. For biodiversity, it is unrealistic to expect that all species are assessed, so it seems unfair to penalize for unassessed species. In the fisheries goal, there are penalties for species that are exploited but not assessed, because if there are landings data, it means they are somewhat measurable, and so it is reasonable to expect they should be at least monitored.</p>
<p>It might be reasonable to penalize unassessed iconic species. It is a smaller list of species that are specifically identified as being of interest, for one reason or other. This would work for species that have some form of assessment - unless that information already exists, it might be unrealistic to try to produce the data layer required to develop a new model.</p>

<div id="sense-of-place" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.12</span> Sense of Place</h2>
<p><strong>Q: Data are only available for marine protected areas, not terrestrial protected areas. Can we still calculate the Lasting Special Places sub-goal?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, it is possible to calculate only the marine component of this sub-goal: this is not ideal but OHI is flexible to work with the data available.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Should we calculate each category used in our assessment (e.g., antiquities, MPAs, beaches of special interest) independently, and then give the same weight (e.g., a third of the goal score) to the three categories, or should we instead pool the actual areas of the 3 categories?</strong></p>
<p>A: Whether you group them together or calculate each category separately depends on reference points. Maybe you want 10% of offshore water to be in MPAs, but only 5% of coastlines to be beaches and 3% Antiquities, for example; in this case, you would calculate them separately and then add them together. But if you want 10% of your country’s coast to have any combination of these things, you would keep them together.</p>

<div id="pressures" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.13</span> Pressures</h2>
<p><strong>Q: How are single ecological pressures (si in Equation S8) calculated?</strong></p>
<p>A: Data included in pressures calculations are accessed in the same manner as any other data layer, and rescaled from 0-1 with an appropriate reference point. For further information, see HowTo_GatherAppropriateData and HowTo_CalculatePressures from ohi-science.org.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does the pressures matrix need to be changed?</strong></p>
<p>A: It is likely that the pressures matrix will not need to be changed. The weights assigned in the matrix were set using information from the literature and by experts; the matrix was created by Halpern et al. 2012.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How is commercial high and low bycatch calculated?</strong></p>
<p>A: Commercial high and low bycatch are categorical values that were set based on fishing gear type. This began as a list of gear types used, producing a range of potential bycatch frequencies (from local reports when possible), which can be rescaled.</p>

<div id="error-rstudio-wont-push-to-github" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.1</span> Error: RStudio won’t push to GitHub</h2>
<p>When pushing committed changes within RStudio, would return the error * <code>error: unable to read askpass response from 'rpostback-askpass'</code> * <code>fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': Device not configured</code> <img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1_yPk-eiJz-9P1VO0Z50bGQSTERM2aKcq6U_un3MlUO4/pub?w=819&amp;h=107" alt="Error screen window: error: unable to read askpass response." /></p>
<p>Here’s how we fixed it: we updated <code>git.exe</code> to the latest version, 2.2.1, edited the search path to point to the new version, made sure the <em>git</em> credential.helper was configured to be able to access the OS X keychain, and pushed a test commit from terminal to store the username and password in the keychain, where it can be accessed from other apps like RStudio. Easy peasy!</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>To check your current version of <code>git.exe</code>, type this at the terminal command line:
<ul>
<li><code>$ git --version</code> should return something like:</li>
<li><code>git version 2.2.1</code> (check online to see if this is the latest version)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To update, go to <a href="http://git-scm.com/download/mac" class="uri">http://git-scm.com/download/mac</a>, download the latest <em>git</em> for OS X, install it.<br /></li>
<li>In terminal, type <code>git --version</code> and verify that it reports the new version. If it shows the new version, great! Skip to Step 5.
<ul>
<li>Don’t be sad if it doesn’t! If you still see the old version, the installer put the new version into a different directory, which has a lower priority in the search path, so now to update the search path. The default Apple <em>git</em> seems to install the <code>git.exe</code> into <code>/usr/bin/</code> directory, this particular updater seems to install into <code>/usr/local/git/bin/</code> directory. The search path needs to be updated to look for <code>git.exe</code> in the new directory first.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To change the search path, open up the paths file in <code>nano</code> editor using <code>sudo</code>:
<ul>
<li><code>$ sudo nano /etc/paths</code></li>
<li>At the top line of the paths file, add the directory for the updated <em>git</em>: <code>’/usr/local/git/bin’</code>(without the quotes) so it looks like the top line here: <img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/11KDJp52kCa-_n4jP97nGZqXc-cKNEvtV-R6M9_neMBg/pub?w=564&amp;h=335" alt="Terminal window showing where to set git filepaths." /></li>
<li>Then hit <code>control-X</code> to exit, then <code>Y</code> in response to the save prompt.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Make sure your <code>git config</code> is up to date, including <code>credential.helper</code>:
<ul>
<li><code>$ git config --global -l</code> should return something like:</li>
<li><code>user.name=&quot;Casey O'Hara&quot;</code></li>
<li><code>user.email=ohara@nceas.ucsb.edu</code>
<ul>
<li>see <a href="https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep/wiki/Setup#git_identity" class="uri">https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep/wiki/Setup#git_identity</a> for help on updating user.name and user.email</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>credential.helper=osxkeychain</code>
<ul>
<li>(if you need to configure the credential helper: <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/" class="uri">https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/</a>)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Now while you are in Terminal, it is important to sync with a repository to establish your security credentials. You must clone a repository and push a ‘test’ commit, and then once you are prompted for your username and password your information will get stored in the keychain. Here are the steps:
<ul>
<li>Change your working directory to your local github directory: <code>$ cd github</code></li>
<li>(Tip: you can check if you’re in the right folder by entering <code>pwd</code>, short for “print working directory”; or you could look at the line of code preceding the “$”.)</li>
<li>Clone into a repository with a URL <em>for which you have permissions</em>. As an example, the following steps use a repository called ‘ZAF’ but you should use your own URL with a three-letter country code in place of ‘ZAF’:</li>
<li><code>$ git clone  https://github.com/omalik/zaf.git</code></li>
<li>Change your working directory to the folder you just created (here, ‘ZAF’): <code>$ cd zaf</code></li>
<li>Push a test commit to repository ‘ZAF’:</li>
<li><code>$ touch test.md</code></li>
<li><code>$ git add test.md</code></li>
<li><code>$ git commit -m &quot;testing&quot;</code></li>
<li><code>$ git status</code></li>
<li><code>$ git push</code></li>
<li>Check your status again: <code>$ git status</code>
<ul>
<li>(TIP: You can check your status with <code>$ git status</code> and you can use ‘ls’ to see if your new changes have registered in this repository.)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Now that <em>git</em> is updated and your username and password are set, make sure RStudio knows the location of the new <code>git.exe</code>. In RStudio, select <strong>Tools &gt; Global Options…</strong>, select the <code>Git/SVN</code>, and browse to the new <code>Git executable</code> (it should appear as <code>/usr/local/git/bin/git</code> if you updated your <em>git</em> version as above). <img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1Y3NrM8mvhRqsMrF2wkTjA0b_Rgfl_2nwU2J6C4p-VUw/pub?w=581&amp;h=542" alt="Checking the options in RStudio for the git executable path." /></li>
</ol>
<p>Next time you push a commit from RStudio, it should remember the username and password from your test commit in Step 6, and you should be good to go.</p>
