### Habitat-based Goals
#### Practical Considerations




#### Notes.

#### regarding habitat health/condition:

<!---Via #362--->

Coral health is based on the % living cover on a reef. Ideally, historical data is available that can provide a reference point for % living cover. For our reference point, we used the mean predicted values for a country from 1985-1987. When this data was not available for a country, we used the value of neighboring countries. (There was also some analyses to control for the fact that the % live coral cover naturally varies over time, hence the use of "predicted values").

For soft-bottom habitat, we estimated status based on the intensity of trawl fishing as a proxy (pages 51 and 52 of SOM 2012).


habitat trend: Change in health/condition over time

Ideally, there will be enough years of data to directly calculate the recent change in health of the habitat (i.e., using a linear model to calculate trend). For example, for sea ice, we fit a linear model to a metric of sea ice cover for data from 2006-2011 (after some smoothing to account for natural variation).

This isn't always the case, and proxies or estimates might need to be used. For example, due to spotty salt marsh data we created trend categories of increasing (0.5), stable (0), and decreasing (-0.5) based on available data.

Notes

<!---From Baltic Workshop--->

CP & CS
Both are habitat based
protection of coastal things by Natural habitats (no credit for walls)

CS: about ability to sequester (pull in) carbon

For both, you’d like a reference point of past habitat and then compare yourself to that. You could restore habitat to increase your score--or protect against further loss. But globally we expect this goal to keep decreasing as we keep destroying.

We weight the habitats based on the amount of protection they provide and the amount carbon they sequester

Q: what are we protecting against?
A: erosion, storm damage. We did spend a lot of time trying to think about the value of the land/people behind the habitats. PNAS paper looking at the US accounting for # of people on the land and the value of the land for coastal habitats. It gets challenging bc uninhabited is important too. Property value is weird because it is a measure of rich people--so we decided what is on land: just focus on what the habitats are and the protection they provide.
At the regional level, could start thinking about these issues (globally there also weren’t the data), but it’s not super democratic--property values and rich people, and uninhabited areas are valuable as well.

Given the habs you have now, what do they compare with what you had?

Ex: in SF bay, invasive marsh plant (spartina). it provides the same kind of CP, but it’s a non-native habitat. It would still count towards CP but would also be a pressure on BD. if habitats change for natural reasons, that might be OK. but if they are introduced species, think about the effects on other goals.

The weights on the habitats--comes from the literature. IF you have region-specific info, use those as weights. Otherwise can use the global weights.
Baltic has a lot of data on habitat types

We excluded kelp forests but sea ice is another one. If you don’t account for longer-term trends could


You need Extent and Condition of each habitat type for both CS and CP. Since Baltic has such good data, you should try to account for both. You might be able to have a better approach than we did.

Q: CS: how long are habitats expected to store carbon?
A: We assumed 100 years based on the literature. Not in fleshy tissue. The long-term. Literature set these weights. But you could change this definition depending on how local studies quantify this.

Explicit: set the ref pt further back in history if you have the data to back it. Use S.M.A.R.T. Principles
Note: It’s ok/good to be more ambitious than the first Global Assessment
