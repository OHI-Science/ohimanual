### Habitat-based Goals
#### Practical Considerations

> Habitat-based goals can be approacahed together in the data gathering process. Habitats appear in such goals as **Carbon Storage**, **Coastal Protection**, and **Biodiversity**..

#### *Ideal Approach*

Ideally, information on the extent and condition of every single habitat type would be available. The reference point for habitat-based goals will likely be temporal. This means that historic data are needed such that current habitat and value data can be compared to historic data. This could also be achieved by using or a proportion of historic data.

#### Ready to start on **Habitats**?

The first thing to consider with habitats is **what habitats are in your area**?

#### More on  health

<!---Via #362--->

Coral health is based on the % living cover on a reef. Ideally, historical data is available that can provide a reference point for % living cover. For our reference point, we used the mean predicted values for a country from 1985-1987. When this data was not available for a country, we used the value of neighboring countries. (There was also some analyses to control for the fact that the % live coral cover naturally varies over time, hence the use of "predicted values").

For soft-bottom habitat, we estimated status based on the intensity of trawl fishing as a proxy (pages 51 and 52 of SOM 2012).


habitat trend: Change in health/condition over time

Ideally, there will be enough years of data to directly calculate the recent change in health of the habitat (i.e., using a linear model to calculate trend). For example, for sea ice, we fit a linear model to a metric of sea ice cover for data from 2006-2011 (after some smoothing to account for natural variation).

This isn't always the case, and proxies or estimates might need to be used. For example, due to spotty salt marsh data we created trend categories of increasing (0.5), stable (0), and decreasing (-0.5) based on available data.

Notes

<!---From Baltic Workshop--->

CP & CS
Both are habitat based
protection of coastal things by Natural habitats (no credit for walls)

CS: about ability to sequester (pull in) carbon

For both, you’d like a reference point of past habitat and then compare yourself to that. You could restore habitat to increase your score--or protect against further loss. But globally we expect this goal to keep decreasing as we keep destroying.

We weight the habitats based on the amount of protection they provide and the amount carbon they sequester

Q: what are we protecting against?
A: erosion, storm damage. We did spend a lot of time trying to think about the value of the land/people behind the habitats. PNAS paper looking at the US accounting for # of people on the land and the value of the land for coastal habitats. It gets challenging bc uninhabited is important too. Property value is weird because it is a measure of rich people--so we decided what is on land: just focus on what the habitats are and the protection they provide.
At the regional level, could start thinking about these issues (globally there also weren’t the data), but it’s not super democratic--property values and rich people, and uninhabited areas are valuable as well.

Given the habs you have now, what do they compare with what you had?

Ex: in SF bay, invasive marsh plant (spartina). it provides the same kind of CP, but it’s a non-native habitat. It would still count towards CP but would also be a pressure on BD. if habitats change for natural reasons, that might be OK. but if they are introduced species, think about the effects on other goals.

The weights on the habitats--comes from the literature. IF you have region-specific info, use those as weights. Otherwise can use the global weights.
Baltic has a lot of data on habitat types

We excluded kelp forests but sea ice is another one. If you don’t account for longer-term trends could


You need Extent and Condition of each habitat type for both CS and CP. Since Baltic has such good data, you should try to account for both. You might be able to have a better approach than we did.

Q: CS: how long are habitats expected to store carbon?
A: We assumed 100 years based on the literature. Not in fleshy tissue. The long-term. Literature set these weights. But you could change this definition depending on how local studies quantify this.

Explicit: set the ref pt further back in history if you have the data to back it. Use S.M.A.R.T. Principles
Note: It’s ok/good to be more ambitious than the first Global

#### Recommendations for Regional Assessments

If comprehensive species biodiversity data exist, these data can be used alone and the sub-goal of habitats can be removed (so that the entire goal is species biodiversity). However, the inventory of marine biodiversity may not often be sufficiently complete to permit that.

#### Global Data Approach

Hi Julie:
I'm not sure if this is an adequate answer, but we can start discussing this!

#### habitat extent: Area of each habitat in each reporting region
#### habitat health/condition: this is the condition of the habitat relative to a reference point.  The ideal situation is if there is historical data that can be compared to the present habitat.  

Some examples:
For mangroves, we divided the current area (2005 data) by the reference area (1980 data).

Coral health is based on the % living cover on a reef.  Ideally, historical data is available that can provide a reference point for % living cover.  For our reference point, we used the mean predicted values for a country from 1985-1987.  When this data was not available for a country, we used the value of neighboring countries.  (There was also some analyses to control for the fact that the % live coral cover naturally varies over time, hence the use of "predicted values").

For soft-bottom habitat, we estimated status based on the intensity of trawl fishing as a proxy (pages 51 and 52 of SOM 2012).

#### habitat trend: Change in health/condition over time
Ideally, there will be enough years of data to directly calculate the recent change in health of the habitat (i.e., using a linear model to calculate trend).  For example, for sea ice, we fit a linear model to a metric of sea ice cover for data from 2006-2011 (after some smoothing to account for natural variation).

This isn't always the case, and proxies or estimates might need to be used.  For example, due to spotty salt marsh data we created trend categories of increasing (0.5), stable (0), and decreasing (-0.5) based on available data.

#### Questions to Consider

I think the approach is going to largely depend on the type of data they have (our approach varies for each habitat because the data is so variable).

Do they have maps, for example, that show current habitat distributions and maps that show historical habitat distributions?  If so, they could extract that data for each of their regions to get a current and reference area. Or, they may have access to summarized habitat data that exists in tables for their regions (or, at smaller scales such as estuary that they can summarize per region)?

Antarctica had sea ice habitat data, there is a script that wallks through downloading and analyzing the data.  But, I'm not sure how helpful that will be.

For Fiji, the only habitat variable that we modified was coral health.  In this case, we had better regional data to estimate coral health (even though the final value we ended up getting was the same).  That was a fairly specialized analysis
