## Pressures and resilience

The same considerations and requirements about data presented in the "**Gathering Appropriate Data**" section also apply to pressures and resilience.

**Pressures** and **Resilience** are two of the four dimensions used to evaluate each goal or sub-goal (the other two are **Status** and **Trend**).

* **Pressures** are the sum of the ecological and social pressures that negatively affect goal scores.
* **Resilience** is the sum of the ecological and social status (e.g., food-web integrity, health of the governance process) and initiatives (e.g., environmental laws, social policies) that can positively affect goal scores by reducing or eliminating pressures. In the figure, likely future state (in yellow) is the result of the trend, minus the negative effect of pressures (grey), plus the positive effect of resilience (salmon pink).

![In the figure, likely future state (in yellow) is the result of the trend, minus the negative effect of pressures (grey), plus the positive effect of resilience (salmon pink)](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1GkLZnW8hQJf1KLX89LzViEBU4PkJ8kRqOERt_Fxtwu4/pub?w=864&h=384)

In theory, every pressure identified for a particular goal or sub-goal should have a corresponding resilience, and every resilience identified should have a corresponding pressure. That way, if the pressure acting on a dataset is 'balanced' by the resilience, there will be no net change on the trend in the status. In practice, however, the resilience and pressure layers you identify may be limited by the data available. The figure below shows pressures measures by category, and the resilience measures meant to 'balance' them for the global assessment. Note that resilience layers were only available for some categories and goals.

![Each resilience data layer should have a corresponding pressures layer, and vice versa. Note that a pressure layer becomes (1-resilience) in cases where only resilience data are available, due to data limitations.](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/19ZBIhzTrNlumV9ZhCmsdEcvybFHp-eN5P5IFAsFmql0/pub?w=558&h=721)


Pressures and resilience are organized in two separate matrices that indicate specifically which measures affect which goals or goal components. Scores are given to rank the importance of the measure, and in the OHI calculations only values above a certain threshold will activate a corresponding pressure or resilience layer.

![Scores from 1-3 are given to rank the importance of each pressure. Only values of 2 or 3 require that a resilience layer be activated when calculating the goal scores.](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1IQhFezmGGAgPS-iZQ_0TfU2FgtV0hv81f2RV9pyiJCI/pub?w=960&h=480)

While pressures and resilience are usually displayed as a two-dimensional matrix, there is actually a third dimension, which is the regions dimension: for each pressure or resilience layer, there are data for each region. These data per region are then multiplied by the ranking weights specific to each goal (1, 2, or 3, with a blank being 0).

![The pressures matrix is three-dimensional: each pressure layer has data per region, which is multiplied by the ranking weights of the pressures matrix.](./fig/ohiman_goals-pressures-regions.png)


### Matrices

In your assessment, as you identify new sources for pressures and resilience layers, you will also need to update the pressures and resilience matrices. To update these matrices, you will need to:  

* Evaluate which pressures and resilience measures included in the global assessment and determine whether they are relevant for the study area of your assessment.
* Evaluate whether the indicators used to capture the pressure and resilience attributes are suitable in your area, or whether you can use regionally-developed indicators instead.
* Identify and categorize new locally-relevant pressures not captured in the global pressures matrix. Make sure you add it under one of the five existing ecological categories or the pressure category (or create a new category if needed).
* Identify and categorize new local resilience measures (laws, regulatory process ranking, food-web integrity) not captured in the global resilience matrix.
* Set pressure and resilience weighting/ranking based on scientific literature and expert opinions.

#### To consider when updating pressures

**Pressure categories**

The OHI framework calculates pressures by first grouping them into an ecological pressure component divided in five categories (pollution, habitat destruction, fishing pressure, species pollution, and climate change) and a social pressure component. The reason behind the ecological categories is to avoid hidden weighting. For example, in the global assessment there were many pollution datasets available, but few distinct habitat destruction datasets. If we simply averaged the individual stressor scores, pollution scores would have a greater influence on the results (stronger weight) just because people have monitored pollution by measuring many separate components.  

Instead, aggregating by pressure categories first ensures that different stressor types influence the score based on the expert-based ranking. Nonetheless, to account for the fact that multiple different stressors within a category are likely to have a cumulative impact that is greater than if only one of the stressors were present, the scores are combined in a cumulative way within each category. The resulting scores are then averaged across ecological pressure categories. This result, in turn, is averaged with the social pressures to produce the final overall pressure score.

**Pressure weights**

Ecological and social pressure components are assessed separately and then the two resulting scores are combined with equal weighting. The weighting can be changed if there is local information or expert opinion on how to do so. Ecological resilience is divided into an ecological integrity score and a regulations score. Any resilience regulation score is associated with a pressure layer. This is because regulations are intended to contrast the effect of pressures. The OHI math is designed assuming that, when the regulation score matches the respective pressure score, they cancel each other out (i.e., the regulation is being effective in keeping the stressor under control). Therefore, by including a layer for regulatory response to each pressure affecting the delivery of the goals, we ensure that the resilience regulation measures are relevant to ocean health.

**Pressure and Status interactions**

Note that a consequence of this structure is that goals may interact with each other. The pressure created by one goal may affect a second goal. For example, cultivating fish for mariculture (food provision sub-goal) can cause genetic escapes threatening the health of wild fish populations (captured through the `sp_genetic` layer in the figure). This pressure affects only the wild-caught fisheries and species sub-goals, but does not affect the mariculture goal itself. In other cases, such as the fishing harvest pressure, the pressure comes as a result of pursuing the food provision sub-goal of wild-caught fisheries, affecting several goals including the fishing sub-goal itself.

### Explore local pressures

Begin by exploring the pressures included in the global pressures matrix. You can explore this in Halpern *et al*. 2012 Supplementary Table S25, or in your assessment repository located at `subcountry2014/conf/pressures_matrix.csv`; (more information on the file system in the section, **File System**). As illustrated below, pressures are either ecological or social, and are grouped into six categories: pollution, habitat destruction, fishing pressure, species pollution, climate change, and social pressures. In the figure, the clean waters goal is affected by four data layers within the pollution category, as well as one in the social category.

![](./fig/pressure_categories.png)

Pressures (columns in `pressures_matrix.csv`) are matched with different goals and subgoals (rows) to indicate which pressures to include when goal scores are calculated. In some cases, the goals are further divided into components (e.g., Habitat type: mangroves, seagrass, corals; natural products: seashells, fish for aquarium, etc.).  

### Updating the pressures matrix

The first step in updating the pressures matrix for your  assessment is to determine if any of the global pressures should be excluded from your study. For example, if there is no mariculture in your study area, perhaps there are also no genetic escapes (`sp_genetic` layer).  

Next, brainstorm local pressures that are not captured in `pressures_matrix.csv`. Which pressures stand out in your study area? Pressures included in the `pressures_matrix.csv` are ultimately determined by available data, and thus there were pressures that were important but could not be included in the global assessment because there were little or no data, such as altered sediment regimes, noise and light pollution, toxic chemicals from point sources, and nutrient pollution from atmospheric deposition, and land-based sources other than fertilizer and pesticide applications to agricultural land). There are likely pressures important to your study area that were not captured in the global pressures matrix. Another reason why pressures in the global assessment may be different than yours may be because of scale: certain sources of pollution, such as mariculture, may be very relevant at the scale of a single bay, but become negligible at the scale of the whole countryâ€™s coastline.

### Some spatial considerations

For pressure layers that are derived from spatially-explicit data, it is important to consider to what portion of the study area that pressure is relevant. For example, in the global study, nutrient and chemical pollution were calculated from the global cumulative impact study (spatial data from Halpern *et al.* 2008). These data were clipped to each global region's EEZ: 200 nm from the coast:

* For some goals, the data clipped to the EEZ affects goals that occur far from shore, so `po_chemicals` applies to goals relevant offshore: FIS, MAR, ECO, and SPP.
* However, some goals are really only relevant nearshore, so we clipped the spatial data again, to 3nm from shore and used this as a separate input. So `po_chemicals_3nm` applies to goals nearshore: AO, CS, CP, TR, ICO, LSP, HAB.

These distinctions won't always apply for smaller-scale assessments. For example, in the US West Coast study (Halpern *et al.* 2014), only a single `po_chemicals` layer was used: we did not distinguish between offshore and 3nm.

### Determine how the pressure affects goals

Next, you will need to determine:

 + which goals are affected by a given pressure layer.
 + the appropriate rank weighting (how important the pressure is for the delivery of the goal/component).
 + which pressure category the new pressure belongs.

These decisions should depend on expert opinions and previous scientific studies.

The original pressure matrix weights for instance were determined by Halpern *et al*. 2012 (*Nature*) based on scientific literature and expert opinion (3=high, 2=medium, and 1=low pressure; stressors that have no impact drop out rather than being assigned a rank of zero, which would affect the average score). Pressures are ranked rather than being represented as a binary (yes/no) measure because the range of consequence of different pressures on each goal can be quite large, and to classify all those pressures as a simple 'yes' would give too much influence to the weakest stressors. For example, food provision is most heavily impacted by unsustainable, high-bycatch fishing, but pollution does have  some impact on fish populations. Without a weighting system, these stressors would be treated equally in their impact on the food provision goal.

Most likely, the new pressure will fit into one of the existing categories. However, depending on the type of pressures in your study area, it is possible that a new pressure category could be created. If you decide to create a new category, be mindful of the implications described above.  


### Identify available pressures data

Like the global study, what pressures you are able to include in your assessment will also depend on data availability. Remember that each column in `pressures_matrix.csv` is a data layer, which requires data for each region in your study area. Begin with a list of local pressures that are important, and then refine if data are not available.

In addition to data for the local pressures you identify, it will likely be possible to find better, local data to replace the global template data layers from the pressures matrix. In this case, you will first find local data and then update the pressure data layer as you would with any other data layer. See the '**Modifying and Creating Data Layers**' section  for how to do this.  

It is important to keep in mind that each pressure layer needs to capture the stressor on a scale that goes from 0 (no stressor at all) to 100 (the highest possible value for the stressor, or the value at which the goal achievement is completely impaired). In other words, when using local data, ensure that you are able to come up with benchmarks to rescale the pressure layer from 0 to 100.

### Explore local resilience

As with the pressures matrix, begin by exploring the resilience measures included in the global resilience matrix (from Halpern *et al*. 2012 Table S26 or `subcountry2014/conf/resilience_matrix.csv`). As illustrated in the figure, resilience is also grouped into ecological and social categories, and includes ecological components, goal-specific regulations, and social components.

In the example below, only one regulatory measure is relevant for the clean waters goal, along with one social integrity measure.

![](./fig/resilience_categories.png)

Goal-specific regulations intend to address ecological pressures, and are measured as laws, regulations, and other institutional measures related to a specific goal. Governance includes the laws or regulations that address the intended objective, implementation of such laws, and whether stated objectives have been effectively met. Social integrity is intended to describe those processes internal to a community that affect its resilience. It is a function of a wide range of aspects of social structure within a region, and may not be strictly marine related, but can inform the level of governance within a region and therefore the ability to respond to or prevent environmental challenges.

The first step in updating the resilience matrix for your assessment is to determine if any resilience measures should be excluded from your study.
Next, brainstorm local resilience measures that are not captured in `resilience_matrix.csv`. What are important regulatory measures to address the stressors youâ€™ve included in your study area? Can you add social resilience measures that are not included in the global assessment?

Ecological integrity in the global assessment was measured as the relative condition of assessed species in a given location, and therefore is only relevant to a subset of goals (wild-caught fisheries, artisanal opportunity, natural products, iconic species, and species). Local measures of this component would potentially allow for more goals to be affected.

### Identify regulatory resilience measures for any new ecological pressures

As you explore any new local resilience measures to be included, remember that any new pressure in the ecological integrity category with a high ranking of (2 or 3) will need a corresponding resilience measure.

### Determine how the resilience measure affects goals

Next, you will need to determine:

 + which goals are affected by a given resilience measure
 + the appropriate rank weighting, (how important the resilience is in counteracting a pressure)
 + whether the resilience measure is social or ecological

These decisions should depend on local expert knowledge and previous scientific studies.


### Identify available resilience data

Resilience measures included in `resilience_matrix.csv` are also determined by available data, coarser spatial resolution, and may not reflect local management targets. When data or indicators are available, you should include them to improve upon resilience measures. You may also ask: What are local management benchmarks that you can use to rescale the resilience layers? Do you have locally-developed indices to capture social resilience that may be more specific to your area than the World Bank governance index? Do you have regional models that might capture the ecological integrity of the foodweb that could replace average extinction risk of IUCN-assessed species?

**Ecological resilience** scores are intended to describe the degree to which there are effective regulations to address ecological pressures, and are measured by assessing the relevant laws and institutional processes. It is difficult to assign a quantitative score to such a complex attribute. Moreover, it is challenging to establish a benchmark to compare that score against, but this is necessary to rescale the resilience score from 0 to 100. In some cases, some numerical indices are readily available and may be used as is (rescaled to the highest observed value, if necessary). In other cases, we had to assign expert-based scores:

1. Existence of regulations: Are regulations in place to appropriately address the ecological pressure?
2. Implementation and Enforcement: Have these regulations been appropriately implemented and are there enforcement mechanisms in place?
3. Effectiveness and Compliance: How effective have the regulations been at mitigating these pressures and is there compliance with these regulations?

**Social resilience** may not be strictly marine related, but can help predict how well a region may be able to respond to or prevent new environmental challenges.
