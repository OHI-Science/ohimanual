### **WILD-CAUGHT FISHERIES**
#### Practical Considerations

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally, data for catch and effort of every commercially- and recreationally-fished species would be available, as well as the functional relationship between fish population size (biomass) and fisheries effort, so that maximum sustainable yield (MSY) could be calculated. Then, fisheries catch and effort information would be used to calculate the present state and MSY would be used to set the reference point. Current status would be calculated using the present state of every individual species and combining each species together, as the weighted proportion of the total catch.

#### Recommendations for regional assessments

Use catch-per-unit effort data if available, and a functional relationship for the reference point. Fisheries modeling using data poor sources was greatly improved in Global 2013 than the original approach in Global 2012. If regional assessments rely solely on catch data, it is highly recommended to use Global 2013 and not Global 2012.
