# Using the Toolbox

>**Section Summary:**

>In this section, you will learn about the most common modifications made to repositories. You will be given examples to follow to help with your own assessment. The most common modifications are changing the pressures and resilience matrices, changing or creating data layers, and changing or removing goals models.

> TIP: You should now have your assessment repository opened and be familiar with the files in the folder.

As your team finalizes which data should be included in the assessment and begins developing goal models, you can incorporate this information into your repository. Data layer files can be created and updated with any software that handles *.csv* files, but goal models must be updated in R. With any modifications you sync to the online repository, the Toolbox will automatically recalculate goal scores. Calculations can also be done locally and offline by running  `subcountry2014/calculate_scores.R`.

This section gives instruction and examples for the most common modifications you will make to your repository:

- **modifying pressures and resilience matrices**
- **modifying and creating data layers for status, trend, pressures and resilience**
- **modifying goal models**
- **removing goals**


The files you will modify are:

![Files you will commonly modify are shown in the figure (Mac navigation is shown above and Windows is shown below). These include the `conf` folder, `layers` folder, and `layers.csv`.](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/10-cx0mlgT9tmy5KN_IKE0TxgojBX6J3U6ahZMMVmNqY/pub?w=964&h=878)
