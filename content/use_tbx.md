# Using the Toolbox

As your team finalizes which data should be included in the assessment and begins developing goal models, you can incorporate this information into your repository. Data files can be created and updated with any software that handles *.csv* files, but goal models must be updated in R. With any modifications you sync to the online repository, the Toolbox will automatically recalculate goal scores. Calculations can also be done locally and offline by running  `subcountry2014/calculate_scores.R`.

This section gives instruction and examples for the most common modifications you will make to your repository:

- **modifying pressures and resilience matrices**
- **modifying and creating data layers for status, trend, pressures and resilience**
- **modifying goal models**
- **removing goals**


The files you will modify are identified in the figure below:
