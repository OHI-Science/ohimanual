### Practical Considerations

#### Recommendations for regional assessments

There are several big decisions to consider when addressing the livelihoods and economies goal. The first is how to weight them when they are combined. In our assessments, the livelihoods and economies sub-goals are equally weighted when they are combined; it is possible to weight them differently.

Another important choice is the reference year that is compared with the current status of livelihoods and economies. We chose a 5-year window because it is intended to capture short-term changes in trajectory, but, in regional assessments, there is the opportunity to study the behavior of the time-series with greater detail and, for example, establish a different time-period that reflects observed cycles, or even process the data to eliminate the “noise” from temporary fluctuations and capture more persistent trends.
