### Discovering Data and Developing Models for Natural Products
#### Where to start on **Natural Products**?

> The **Natural Products** goal describes how sustainably people harvest non-food products from the sea.

*Ideal Approach*

Ideally, quantity, value, and a sustainability rating of the harvest method would be available for every marine and coastally-derived natural product within the regions of a study area. This could include a wide range of products depending on what is harvested in the study area, including corals, shells, seaweeds, aquarium fish, mangrove wood, or any non-food marine product that is harvested within a region. The ideal reference point would be derived from a functional relationship of the sustainability of the harvest for each product relative to the amount of product available in the ecosystem, informed by scientific studies. Without such information, assumptions and expert judgment will need to be made to set the reference point.

*Practical Guidance*

Whether you use the approach from the global assessment or are developing your own new model entirely, there are a few tasks that will remain the same because are key to the philosophy of this goal.

The first is to identify **identify which products are in your study area.** For example, does your study area have corals, ornamental fishes, sponges? Does your area yield medicines from the sea, or other products that are not used for nutrition under **Food Provision**? Does your area harvest drinking water from the ocean through desalination plants? Is there a kelp or seaweed industry in your area? If there are multiple uses of the product, you must also consider what proportion of the product is used for food, and what proportion is used for other purposes. As another example, oil from marine mammals was considered but excluded from the global models, but if a region has a considerable amount of mammal oil harvest, they should include it in the calculation, keeping in mind that the sustainability of this type of harvest is likely to be low and should be reflected in the score.

The second task is to think about **where these products are harvested and how much of them are harvested** in these areas through a period of time. You should find spatial representation of these products, which can be done by knowing where they are derived from. Do they come from certain habitats (in the case of coral) or animals (in the case of fish oil)? This information will help calculate the sustainability of the harvest of eah natural product.  harvest amounts and the spatial data are used to calculate **exposure** further on, and can also be used to set the **relative weighting** between the products. These spatial data may have already been used in other goals, or they may lead you to find useful data that can be used in other parts of the assessment (See **Best Approaches**).

The second task is to think about **where these products are harvested and how much of them are harvested** in these areas through a period of time. You will have to assign geographic representation of these products, which can be done by knowing where they are derived from, ideally, or by assigning relative weightings. Do they come from certain habitats (in the case of coral) or animals (in the case of fish oil)? This information will help calculate the sustainability of the harvest of eah natural product.  harvest amounts and the spatial data are used to calculate **exposure** further on, and can also be used to set the **relative weighting** between the products. These spatial data may have already been used in other goals, or they may lead you to find useful data that can be used in other parts of the assessment (See **Best Approaches**).

The third component is to try to find the **sustainability** coefficients of the identified products. It is possible to measure sustainability in a number of different ways. Quantitative information can be used, or expert judgment, perhaps based on information or rough estimates of how sustainable the harvest method is, which is what was done in Global 2012. We based the sustainability component on the historical maximum harvest recorded, the maximum harvesting density recorded, and risk status assessments by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).  In the absence of these, we borrowed general principles from fisheries models to provide rough estimates. If these are given values you could simplify the model, or they could be derived from two factors, **exposure and risk**. The **exposure** will come from the spatio-temporal harvest amount data already prepared, and the **risk** will come from the scientific literature or a developed indicator. For both of those cases, the values can be calculated in separate equations as part of your data preparation process.

> Global assessments borrow principles from fisheries science to make estimates of product sustainability. In the Global 2013 assessment the sustainability component was derived from the historical maximum harvest recorded, the maximum harvesting density recorded, and risk status assessments by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).

One very important thing to consider at this point is your **reference point for the relative harvest amount**. The relative harvest of your data is multiplied by the sustainability coefficient in the last step. Setting the reference point is a decision your team must make based on the available data and an inferred functional relationship between the harvest of the product and the amount in the system. Understanding the patterns in harvest can help inform how to set the reference point. For example, knowing whether harvesting effort was constant or whether product yields changed due to the market demand and not the availability. This information could help inform whether it is more appropriate to set the reference point as the peak yield of the time-series, or some percentage above or below, or some other approach that is both ambitious and realistic (**SMART** principles). The decision you make for the reference point should be based on the trend of the data; for instance, if your harvests have only increased over time, which may be indicative of an emerging economy, you will have to account for that.

I think having a graph of harvest yields as a time series, by product, would be a helpful visual.-->

Example: The Global assessment used the following information in the Natural Products equations:

product | relative tonnes (1) | weighting (2) | Exposure (3) | Risk (4)
----------|---------------------|-------------|--------------|------
coral | FAO |  FAO | coral habitat | all 1
sponges | FAO | FAO | coral + rocky reef habitat | all 0
ornamentals | FAO | FAO | coral + rocky reef habitat | 1 if blast/cyanide fishing, otherwise 0
fish oil | FAO | FAO | fish score/100 | --
shells | FAO | FAO | coral + rocky reef habitat | all 0
seaweeds | FAO | FAO | rocky reef habitat | --

#### Examples of the Approach

Assessment | Developing the Model  | Setting the Reference Point | Lessons Learned
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
**Global 2012** | The products used were coral, ornamental fish, fish oil, seaweeds and marine plants, shells, and sponges. Data were from the UN FAO. Each category was weighted by the sustainability of harvest. For the status of each product, we assessed the most recent harvest (in metric tons) per region relative to a fraction of the maximum value (in 2008 USD) ever achieved in that region. | A score of 100 would indicate that a region’s natural product yield equals 65% of its historic maximum. |  Some products of interest had no data available.
**Global 2013** | The goal model had the same approach as Global 2012, with updated data processing. | The reference point was the same as the Global 2012. | The study produced new gapfilling methods. This used estimated US dollar values of harvested products from the tonnage reported, or the tonnage harvested based on a product’s reported economic value.
**Brazil (2014)** | The method was the same as Global 2012. | The reference point was the same as Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2012.
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | This goal was not included in this assessment due to lack of data availability. | N/A | There were too few data available on local-scale harvest, and in the past had occurred mostly in one Californian region. Including this goal in the assessment would have lowered the overall Index score.
