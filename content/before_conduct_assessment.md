## Before conducting an assessment

>**Section Summary:**

>This section advises you on how to plan for a successful assessment. From engaging decision-makers early on, to maintaining future assessment efforts, here are some key points to consider.

Before conducting an assessment, it is important to prepare the following:

* Develop a strategic plan and timeline
    + establish the need for an assessment
    + define the spatial scale of the assessment: country, state, eco-region, etc.
    + determine the resources available
    + outline a timeline with necessary meetings and workshops
    + engage decision-makers early for results to be most useful
* Assemble a qualified team with diverse skills and knowledge, including:
    + a broad scientific understanding and experience with environmental policy
    + ability to manage large data sets, make decisions, and think creatively
    + capacity to collaborate in a multidisciplinary team, remotely and in person
    + team members who can use the statistical programming language R (http://cran.r-project.org/), ArcGIS or other spatial analysis software, and are fluent in English
* Funding
    + greatly depends on the local context
    + potentially needed for a management and scientific team, workshops and meetings (including travel), communications, policy engagement, and operating costs
* Policy and management interest
    + engage decision-makers early: informing policies to improve ocean health is most effective if there is early interest and engagement from government agencies and decision-making bodies
    + requires ongoing communication during Index development to best inform management actions
    + repeated assessments as new data become available enable tracking ocean health through time and evaluating management and policy interventions
