##Example of Food Provision

> Draft updated 03-20-15

Here are some questions to help countries think about how they might modify their Food Provision models. The data questions help identify modeling options and are mainly aimed at technical experts. The reference point questions are philosophical choices that should involve high-level decision makers on the team. The reference point options, however, are constrained by what data are available, so it would be ideal to have both types of expertise present in the discussion.

##Fisheries
**Assessed stocks:**

*Assessed stocks are stocks for which a formal stock assessment exists.*

- Do you have a set Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY), or biomass at maximum sustainable yield (Bmsy)?
- Do you know the fishing effort needed to harvest at MSY?
- Do you have official catch statistics, or catch per unit effort (CPUE)?
- How many years of data are in your catch time-series?

**Unassessed stocks**

*We recommend using at least two different data-poor models for unassessed stocks.
 Then you should ask yourselves these questions to help interpret the results:*

- Are there fisheries for which harvest regulations were put in place for certain years?
- Are there bycatch regulations, such as for which species may be caught or which gear may be used?
- Are there fisheries that were abandoned because of loss of market value?
- Are there fisheries with high market value that are still profitable even if CPUE declined?
- Are there specific issues with under-reporting or unregulated, unreported illegal fishing (UUI) that can be taken into account?

**Reference point:**
- What are the official management targets for sustainable fisheries? For example, is a fishery at 90% of Bmsy considered 'sustainable'? What about 50%?
- What are the thresholds for 'under-fishing'? If a policy is in place, is it there to conserve resources or to expand usage of under-utilized fisheries?

**Additional checks:**

*Compare the list of species for which you have data with the species identified in the OHI global data:*

- Are there any species in the OHI global data that you don’t have in your own data? This could be due to an error in the OHI global data, but it might be worth double-checking to see if there are any records for the relevant fisheries. This is worth doing especially if the species involved are commercially valuable.
- Are there any species for which informal assessments exist? They can be used to check the data-poor model outputs.

*Make sure the resilience values come from the correct source before converting:*
- Are they r_m, r_max, or something else?

##Mariculture

####Potential information you could gather:

*General tips:*
- Re-do your own sustainability ranking. This is useful specially if there are few species, and if they were not originally assessed in the MSI (Trujillo, 2008).
- Use national data on harvested tonnes. Data at this scale may be more accurate than that international FAO data.

*Spatial information:*
- Do you have data on the specific regions where species are being cultivated? Do you have maps of where they’re cultivated?
- Are there regulations for which sites can be cultivated? For example, are there required levels of water quality for mariculture?
- Do you have maps of where sites are allowed?
- Do you have any information on production density?

** Reference point: **

*Based on what information you gather, and on what is known of the species, you might be able to have a reference point for maximum sustainable productivity. For example, this may be possible for bivalves if you know cultivation density.*

- Are there any official management objectives for mariculture? For example, is there a plan to increase mariculture by a certain target? Are there areas that should be banned from mariculture because they should be reserved for other uses?
- Does it make sense to use population density as a measure for mariculture need?
- Does it make sense to use China as a reference point?

**Additional checks:**

*Compare the list of species for which you have data with the species identified in the OHI global data:*
- Are there any species in the OHI global data that you don’t have in your own data? This could be due to an error in the OHI global data, but it might be worth double-checking to see if there are any records for the relevant fisheries. This is worth doing especially if the species involved are commercially valuable.

###Food Provision FAQ

####Q: I have fish that are used as feed for other fish (e.g., sprat) in my country. Can I include them in this goal?

 A: It would be more appropriate to include them in Natural Products rather than Food Provision. This is because they are not being consumed directly. Fish such as sprat, for example, may be used to feed pigs in addition to other fish, and therefore you would need to know how much (tonnage) is being produced, and where it is going to be able to accurately distinguish these categories to avoid double-counting.
