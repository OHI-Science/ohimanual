####Practical Considerations

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally,  information would be available to allow you to to assess the amount of carbon stored in every coastal habitat. The best information would show area covered and some measure of the quality of the habitat for this goal. For example, a dense mangrove forest would be better quality than a sparse mangrove forest. Additionally, different weights would be assigned to the habitats based on their relative ability to store carbon, and this factor could be used to penalize areas where there is greater loss of carbon and reward areas where this is a greater storage of carbon. The carbon storage model could then incorporate such weights in a similar way to the **Coastal Protection** goal. The reference point for habitat-based goals will likely be temporal in most cases. This means that historic data are needed so that current habitat values can be compared to a past state.

>TIP: Understanding habitat storage is an active area of ongoing research. The capacity for habitats to store carbon varies with ecological factors including the morphology of plants in the system.

####Recommendations for your assessment

The overall **Carbon Storage** model and approach should not change from what is used in the current Global model. Knowing the area and the condition of of carbon-storing habitats are the two components that are most important. For example, if you have area of mangrove coverage and density of the mangroves within that area, you will find more robust results. It may not be the case in practice to have both variables, however.

#### Where to Look?

Habitats included in this goal should store carbon for 100 years or more, not temporarily store it only to be quickly cycled back into the system.
