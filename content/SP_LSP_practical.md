### **LASTING SPECIAL PLACES**
#### Practical Considerations

The type of reference point used will depend on the data available.

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally one would have (or develop) a list of all the places that people within a region consider special, and then assess what percent of and how well those areas are protected. The type of reference point used will depend on the data available.

#### Notes

<!---LSP in the global are the same as MPA resilience protected areas--->
