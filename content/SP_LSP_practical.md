##Sense of Place
###LASTING SPECIAL PLACES
##Practical Considerations

###*Ideal Approach*:

Ideally one would have (or develop) a list of all the places that people within a region consider special, and then assess what percent of and how well those areas are protected. The type of reference point used will depend on the data available.

**History of the Approach (lessons learned 2014)**
<!---Taken from Conceptual Guide v2--->

Lasting Special Places
This sub-goal focuses instead on those geographic locations that hold particular value for aesthetic, spiritual, cultural, recreational or existence reasons. The scores for this sub-goal are calculated based upon two assumptions: that all regions have roughly the same percentage of their coastal areas (outward to 3 nm and inland to 1 km from the shore) that qualify as lasting special places, and that the regions with the most protected areas are the closest to achieving their region-specific target.

####Model description

**Global 2012:**
The status of this sub-goal is calculated by combining the percent of coastal waters that are coastal marine protected areas and the percent of coastline that is protected. Both sea and land components are compared to a target (reference point) of 30% protection.

**Global 2013:**
Same as Global 2012.

**Brazil:**
Same as Global 2012.

**US West Coast:**
Same as Global 2012.
Evolution of the approach:

**Global 2012:**
This sub-goal is particularly hard to quantify, because there are no lists of marine places protected especially for their cultural, spiritual, aesthetic or related intangible values.  Ideally one would survey every community around the world to determine the top list of such special places, and then assess how those locations are faring relative to a desired state (e.g., protected or well managed), but in the absence of such lists we assume areas that are protected for other reasons (e.g. MPAs, reserves, historical areas, World Heritage sites, etc.) represent these special places (i.e. the effort to protect them suggests they are important places) and that in each region there are enough special places to cover at least 30% of the coastal strip. Clearly this is an imperfect assumption, but in many cases it was true so that it did not prove unrealistic.

**Global 2013:**
Same as Global 2012.

**Brazil:**
Same as Global 2012.

**US West Coast:**
This approach also focuses on the protection status of all marine and coastal areas as was done in the global assessment, under the assumption that efforts to protect places suggest that they are significant to people. We recognize that for some individuals, placing regulations on an area to protect it may prevent them from the very activities that made those places special to them in the first place, such that higher protection may not represent a healthier state in their view. However, we use this approach here because data exist to calculate it and because, although imperfect, it does convey some information about lasting special places. If a place is special and appropriate regulations/protection are placed on that location (for example, limited access, restrictions or limits on uses such as fishing, etc.), we feel that this ensures long-term sustainability of a place people care about.

####The reference point:

**Global 2012:**
Using lists of protected areas as the catalogue of special places then creates the problem of determining a reference condition. We do not know how many special places have yet to be protected, and so we end up having all identified special places also being protected. To solve this problem we make two important assumptions. First, we assume that all regions have roughly the same percentage of their coastal waters and coastline that could qualify as lasting special places. In other words, they all have the same reference target (as a percentage of the total area). Second, we assume that protecting 30% of the coastal area is a target that allows protecting enough lasting special places to achieve the goal.

**Global 2013:**
Same as Global 2012.

**Brazil:**
Same as Global 2012.

**US West Coast:**
Same as Global 2012.

####Interpreting a score:

A score of 100 would indicate that 30% of the waters and land immediately adjacent to the coast is protected.
