### **LIVELIHOODS**
#### Practical Considerations

#### *Ideal Approach*

Ideally, this goal would capture all marine sectors that supply jobs and wages to coastal communities, incorporating information on the sustainability of different sectors and also working conditions and job satisfaction/identity. The jobs and revenue produced from marine-related industries directly benefit those who are employed, but also those that gain substantial indirect value from community identity, tax revenue, and other related economic and social impacts of a stable coastal economy. Capturing the indirect as well as direct benefits from jobs, wages and revenue from coastal communities and beyond is best; where data do not exist, multipliers derived from the literature can be incorporated into jobs to attempt to capture this. The reference point in this sub-goal will likely be set as a moving window temporal approach and/or a spatial comparison.

The Livelihoods sub-goal includes two equally important sub-components, the number of jobs, which is a proxy for livelihood quantity, and the per capita average annual wages, which is a proxy for job quality.

#### Recommendations for regional assessments

Within the livelihoods sub-goal, there is also the possibility of weighting the two subcomponents unequally (in all three assessments these are weighted equally), for example if the number of jobs was considered more important than the wages rendered.

There is another important decision to be made: what is a marine-related sector? There are jobs that are directly connected to the marine environment (fishing, shipping, ports,) but also some that are connected indirectly (suppliers, supporting industries). The use of multipliers in attempts to capture the indirect revenue generated by jobs more indirectly associated to marine sectors is important to include if possible; this is a well-established method in economics (see Evolution of the Approach, below).
In terms of reference points: in the livelihoods sub-goal, jobs had a moving target temporal comparison and wages had a spatial comparison. Comparing the number of jobs across different places would require at the very least adjusting values by the size of the workforce in each location. We highly recommend keeping the reference point for jobs as a temporal comparison, and only using a spatial comparison for wages (adjusted by purchasing power).

<!---Taken from Conceptual Guide v2--->

#### Model description

**Global 2012:**
This sub-goal is measured as the number of direct and indirect jobs across sectors within a region plus the average purchasing power parity (PPP)-adjusted wages within each sector. Jobs are summed across sectors and measured at current and reference time points. Wages are averaged across sectors within each region and the reference value is taken from the region with the highest average wages across all sectors.

**Global 2013:**
Based on Global 2012, with some simplifications: Since many of the values were not available in 2010, older wages data were divided by the inflation conversion factor for 2010 so that wage data across years would be comparable in 2010 US dollars. These data were also multiplied by the purchasing power parity-adjusted per capita GDP (PPPpcGDP). Jobs data were adjusted by dividing by total number of people employed for the corresponding year: (1 â€“ percent unemployment) * total labor force. This factor ensures that any changes detected are strictly due to marine-related dynamics and not driven by national macroeconomic events across all sectors, marine and not. One of the adjustment terms previously used was considered redundant and removed: an additional factor had previously been used to modify the wages data, obtained from the International Labour Organization (ILO).

**Brazil:**
Same as Global 2012.

**US West Coast:**
This goal follows the same model as in Global 2012, but using local data with a slightly different list of sectors. Data came from the National Ocean Economics Program (NOEP); sectors include: living resources, tourism and recreation, shipping and transport, marine related construction, and ship and boat building/repair. For each of these sub-components we use sector-specific multipliers derived from the NOEP data so that we assess both direct and indirect effects. We recognize that sectors and economic activity within a region can be influenced by activities outside the region (e.g., fish caught in Alaska could be brought to Washington for processing, or vice-versa), thus leading to an over or under estimate economic benefits derived from marine ecosystems within the study region. As with any ecosystem study, defining boundaries for the ecosystem is an artificial operation, and linkages with external elements necessarily exist but are challenging to account for.

#### Evolution of the approach

**Global 2012:**
We assumed that sector-specific job and revenue multipliers are static and globally consistent, but distinct for developed versus developing regions (when such information was available), because we do not have data to resolve temporal or regional differences. For all other sectors where the data sources only provided direct jobs or direct revenue, we used sector- and development status-specific multipliers derived from the literature to estimate total job or revenue impacts. We did not apply multiplier values to wages since the cascading effects of earned income are more contentious. To account for broader economic forces that may affect jobs independent of changes in ocean health (e.g., a global recession), we adjusted (as noted above) relative values for the number of jobs by changes in national employment rates.

While job identity has social and cultural value, there are not adequate data to track individual workers and assess their job satisfaction on a global scale. Also because of data constraints, this goal does not provide more credit for sectors or economic activities that are more ecologically sustainable.

**Global 2013:**
Same as Global 2012 except for a few simplifications in terms of multipliers.

**Brazil:**
Same as Global 2012.

**US West Coast:**
Same as Global 2012.

#### The reference point

**Global 2012:**
In the livelihoods sub-goal, jobs had a moving target temporal comparison and wages had a spatial comparison. The reference point for jobs (and for the economies sub-goal) is a moving baseline because there is no established target for number of jobs (and setting a specific target number of jobs would be completely arbitrary). In these cases it is important to compare the same place to itself in the past, and not to compare it to a different place. Therefore, the objective of the jobs component is actually no loss of jobs. In addition, we want to ensure that we are detecting changes that are specific to marine-related sectors. Jobs must keep pace with growth in employment rates or sustain losses no greater than national increases in unemployment rates. For wages we assumed the target value for average annual wages is the highest value observed across all reporting units.

**Global 2013:**
Same as Global 2012.

**Brazil:**
Same as Global 2012.

**US West Coast:**
Same as Global 2012.

#### Interpreting a score:
A score of 100 would indicate that the number of marine jobs had not reduced relative to that number five years previous, and that the wages in the area were the highest anywhere.
