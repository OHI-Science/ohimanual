### Practical Considerations for Special Places

#### Ready to start on **Special Places**?

*Ideal Approach*

Ideally one would have (or develop) a list of all the places that people within a region consider special, and then assess what percent of and how well those areas are protected. A special places could also be one based on the extent to which people partaking in spiritual or religious activities are able to access special places.

*Practical Guidance*

It is important to think creatively about how this goal can be tailored more effectively to a specific region. This sub-goal is intended to be location-specifc, and therefore will vary across assessments. You should look at example assessments to see what other studies have done.

You should be thinking about **Resilience** at the same time as you think about **Lasting Special Places** sub-goal of **Special Places**. This is because the **LSP** sub-goal makes use of protected areas--hence the "lasting" imlied in the name--and the same information gathered on projected areas can be used to create resilience data layers (See section, **Pressures and Resilience**).

> TIP: LSP in the global are the same as MPA resilience protected areas--->

Once you area ready, you should return to the **Iconic Species** sub-goal of **Lasting Special Places** and think about how to combine the two together. Do you want to use equal or unequal weighting? How do the two components relate to each other?

> In the Global Assessment framework, the **Special Places** sub-goals were weighted equally and combined in an average to create a single goal score. The two sub-goals are averaged currently in the framework. But these could be combined with a weighted average, or even a different sub-goal instead of Sense of Place.

The type of reference point used will depend on the data available. It will very likely be a temporal reference point--some time in the past when things were pristine or somehow determined to be protected at their best.
