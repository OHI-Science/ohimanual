### Practical Considerations for **Sense of Place**

#### Ready to start on the **Lasting Special Places** sub-goal of the **Sense of Place** Goal?

> Remember, **Sense of Place** has another sub-goal, **Iconic Species**, which is described in the *Species goals* section.

*Ideal Approach*

Ideally, you would be able to produce a list of all the places that people within your region consider special, and then assess how well they are protected. How well they are protected could be the percentage of area protected, and you could also find how well they are protected using other data. This sub-goal could also be based on the extent to which people partaking in spiritual or religious activities are able to access special places.

*Practical Guidance*

It is important to think about how this goal can be tailored to your region. This sub-goal is intended to be meaningful and specific to your location. Keep in mind, however, that it is a difficult goal to express accurately, since it attempts to capture how people interact culturally with their coastal places.

> In the U.S. West Coast assessment (2014), **Special Places** was one of the most important goals. At the end of the day, how people interact with ‘their ocean’ is fundamentally important to whether they think oceans are healthy or not.

The main consideration for this sub-goal is the spatial data and the list of protected areas. Typically in assessments, the area of designated protected places relative to a target of thirty percent coastal area protected is used as a measure. Coastal area could be based off a 1 km^2 buffer, as in the Global Assessment, or it could be based on what is reasonable to your area; in any case, you would want to consider how far out from shore you should include as well; would it be 3 nautical miles, or as far as your territorial waters up to 12 nautical miles?

> In the Brazil Assessment (2014), the **Lasting Special Places** sub-goal was assessed using a national database of protected areas that included fully-protected and sustainable use designations at federal, state and municipal levels, and included indigenous lands. The highest-scoring area contained the largest continuous extent of protected areas within the country in what is called the Biodiversity Corridor of Amapa´.

Data sources should be specific to your region. International databases, like the World Database of Protected Areas, offer rich information, but they may not be as up-to-date as the list of national parks in your area, and may not have as much information on the quality of protection. If you have more information on quality, you could think about another approach than the thirty percent reference point target.

*Thinking Ahead*

You should be thinking about **Resilience** at the same time as you think about **Lasting Special Places** sub-goal of **Special Places**. This is because the **LSP** sub-goal makes use of protected areas, and some of the same information gathered on projected areas can be used to create resilience data layers like Marine Protected Areas (See section, **Pressures and Resilience**).

Once you area ready, you should return to the **Iconic Species** sub-goal of **Lasting Special Places** and think about how to combine the two together. Do you want to use equal or unequal weighting? How do the two components relate to each other?

> In the Global Assessment framework, the **Special Places** sub-goals were weighted equally and combined in an average to create a single goal score. The two sub-goals are averaged currently in the framework. But these could be combined with a weighted average, or even a different sub-goal instead of **Sense of Place**.

#### History of the Approach

Assessment | Model Description and Reference Point | Evolution of Approach | Interpreting a score
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
**Global 2012** | The status of this sub-goal is calculated by combining the percent of coastal waters that are coastal marine protected areas and the percent of coastline that is protected. Both sea and land components are compared to a target (reference point) of 30% protection.<br  /><br  />Using lists of protected areas as the catalogue of special places then creates the problem of determining a reference condition. We do not know how many special places have yet to be protected, and so we end up having all identified special places also being protected. To solve this problem we make two important assumptions. First, we assume that all regions have roughly the same percentage of their coastal waters and coastline that could qualify as lasting special places. In other words, they all have the same reference target (as a percentage of the total area). Second, we assume that protecting 30% of the coastal area is a target that allows protecting enough lasting special places to achieve the goal. | This sub-goal is particularly hard to quantify, because there are no lists of marine places protected especially for their cultural, spiritual, aesthetic or related intangible values.  Ideally one would survey every community around the world to determine the top list of such special places, and then assess how those locations are faring relative to a desired state (e.g., protected or well managed), but in the absence of such lists we assume areas that are protected for other reasons (e.g. MPAs, reserves, historical areas, World Heritage sites, etc.) represent these special places (i.e. the effort to protect them suggests they are important places) and that in each region there are enough special places to cover at least 30% of the coastal strip. Clearly this is an imperfect assumption, but in many cases it was true so that it did not prove unrealistic. | A score of 100 would indicate that 30% of the waters and land immediately adjacent to the coast is protected.
**Global 2013** | The model and reference point were the same as Global 2012. | The approach was same as Global 2012 |
**Brazil (2014)** | The model and reference point were the same as Global 2012. | The approach was same as Global 2012 |
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | The model and reference point were the same as Global 2012. | This approach also focuses on the protection status of all marine and coastal areas as was done in the global assessment, under the assumption that efforts to protect places suggest that they are significant to people. We recognize that for some individuals, placing regulations on an area to protect it may prevent them from the very activities that made those places special to them in the first place, such that higher protection may not represent a healthier state in their view. However, we use this approach here because data exist to calculate it and because, although imperfect, it does convey some information about lasting special places. If a place is special and appropriate regulations/protection are placed on that location (for example, limited access, restrictions or limits on uses such as fishing, etc.), we feel that this ensures long-term sustainability of a place people care about. |
