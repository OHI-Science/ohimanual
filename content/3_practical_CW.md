#### Practical Considerations for Clean Waters and Pollution

*Ideal Approach*

> The **Clean Waters** goal captures the degree to which local waters are unpolluted by natural and human-made causes.

Ideally, data would be available and combined from different categories of marine pollution to best capture the factors that can cause waters to become unsuitable for recreation, enjoyment, and other purposes. The type of reference point used will depend on the data available, although a functional relationship would be best for setting limits to uses.

*Practical Guidance*

> You should use more refined data than the Global Assessment data, because they rely heavily on proxy data for water quality. However, you should follow the same approach of the geometric mean to sum up the data layers that you find.

First think about what kind of point and non-point sources of pollution are in your area. Are there known sources of trash and marine debris? Is there a population does not have access to sanitation? Does your wastewater get effectively treated before it is discharged into the environment? How does urban runoff contribute to your local coastal waters?

You should try to use in-situ measurements of water quality. This could include monitoring data for pathogen levels, chemical contaminants, or even harmful algal blooms. For example, data on the frequency and location of anoxic conditions or eutrophication would be a direct indicator of quality, rather than an indirect indicator based on the proxy of nutrient input from agriculture or land-based sources. You could also find information upstream, and use information on the watershed to calculate inputs into the ocean.

If you don't have such information, or have partial information on one of these inputs, you could combine it with population data or model the data to estimate how much of an impact--or how much intensity through input--it has on coastal areas. Do you have population density information over time? You could then use this later to calculate the trend.

>In the 2012 Global Assessment, these data layers are scores spatially for 3 nautical miles out from shore. This is because it concentrates the effect of the inputs to coastal regions and makes them visible to the shoreline. You can change this value in your spatial analysis.

Where possible, you should think about categories of inputs that are not used in the Global Assessments. These include information on toxic algal blooms, oil spills, turbidity or sediment input, and floating trash, and think about how they can fit in to the model areas.

| Input | Related data |
|-----|----------|
| Nutrients | Modeled plumes from land-based nitrogen inputs, fertilizer usage, algal blooms, eutrophication |
| Pathogens | Access to sanitation, population density, wastewater treatment |
| Chemicals | Organic pesticides, inorganic pesticides, toxic chemicals, chemicals from shipping, urban runoff |
| Trash | Floating trash, plastic inputs, uncollected waste |
| Other | Turbidity, altered sedimentation |

*Keep the Model*

In any case, it is recommended that your categories are combined in a geometric mean as in the Global approach. This guarantees that if any one of the components scores poorly, the higher scores from other components will note hide the effect.

*Thinking Ahead*

The **Clean Waters** goal is connected to the **Pressures** layers. You should approach the both of them at the same time where possible. (See the sections on **Pressures and Resilience** to understand more.)

>In the Global Assessment, marine debris from plastic pollution is one of the pressures layers. The same data are also used in the **Clean Waters** goal, but they are inverted such that a low value of debris is a high score in the goal. This is commonly done for these interchangeable data layers.

### History of the Approach

Assessment | Model Description and Reference Point | Evolution of Approach | Interpreting a score
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
**Global 2012** | We aggregated various measures of pollution into four components that comprise the Clean Waters goal: eutrophication (nutrients), chemicals, pathogens and marine debris. This decision was meant to represent a comprehensive list of the contamination categories that are commonly considered in assessments of coastal clean waters and for which we could obtain datasets. The status of this goal is calculated as the geometric mean of four components: the number of people without access to sanitation (i.e. coastal population density times % without access to enhanced sanitation), 1 – (nutrient input), 1 – (chemical input), and 1 – (marine debris input).<br  /><br  />We used a geometric mean, as is commonly done for water quality indices, because a very bad score for any one sub-component would pollute the waters sufficiently to make people feel the waters were ‘too dirty’ to enjoy for recreational or aesthetic purposes (e.g. a large oil spill trumps any other measure of pollution).<br  /><br  />This goal scores highest when the contamination level is zero. |  Because of limited data availability for chemical pollution, we measured the chemicals component as the average of land-based organic pollution, land-based inorganic pollution and ocean-based pollution from commercial shipping and ports. We did not have global data for oil spills and so could not include oil pollution (although we did include pollution from ships), but in future assessments where such data exist it would be included in chemical pollution as well. In all four cases, the status of these components is the inverse of their intensity (i.e., high input produces a low status).<br  /><br  />Human-derived pathogens reach coastal waters primarily from sewage discharge or direct human defecation. Since we did not have access to a global database of in situ measurements of pathogen levels, we used a proxy measure for the status of pathogen pollution, namely the number of people in coastal areas without access to improved sanitation facilities. The underlying assumption is that locations with a low percentage of people with access to improved facilities will likely have higher levels of coastal water contamination from human pathogens. To estimate this pathogen intensity, we multiplied average population density within the 50km of land adjacent to coasts by the percentage of the population without access to improved sanitation. This allows regions with low coastal population densities and low access to improved sanitation to score better than high population regions with better access if the absolute number of people without access is lower in the small region. | A score of 100 would indicate that the contamination level is zero.
**Global 2013** | The goal model and reference point were the same as Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2012. |
**Brazil (2014)** | The goal model and reference point were the same as Global 2012. | Data used to model the components for eutrophication (nutrients) and chemicals was the same as in Global 2012. In short, nutrient pollution is estimated using a model of land-based nitrogen inputs and chemical pollution is measure via three global datasets on pollution from agricultural pesticide use, runoff from impervious surfaces, and commercial shipping and ports. Data to characterize pathogen and marine debris pollution were developed using state-level data for Brazil. We used the same approach to model both components, namely the number of people in coastal areas without access to sewage treatment (pathogens), and without access to improved solid waste management of three types (marine debris). |
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | The model was the same as Global 2012, with regional instead of global data.<br  /><br  />The reference point for pathogens was modified due to better data available. This was set as the number of days when beaches were closed to bathers because pathogen counts were higher than state standards. | The approach was the same as Global 2012, with regional instead of global data. |
