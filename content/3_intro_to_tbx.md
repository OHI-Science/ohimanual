# The Ocean Health Index Toolbox

>**Section Summary:**

>In this section, you will learn the basics of how to use OHI tools for conducting an assessment. You will be introduced to the files you will be working with, how to prepare them, and you will learn how concepts such as status, trend, pressures, and resilience are used together to create the final score. You will also learn what to do in cases of missing data.

> TIP: Knowing where your data gaps are will make gapfilling easier in this process.

**The OHI Toolbox** is an ecosystem of data, scripts, and structure required to calculate OHI scores at any scale. Toolbox scripts are open source, written in the software language R, and data inputted into the Toolbox are **comma-separated-value**, or *.csv* files, which can be created or edited using text editors or Microsoft Excel. Files are stored within two folders called **repositories**, or *(repos)*, such that

> OHI Toolbox = your assessment repo + `ohi core functions` repo.

We access and interact with the Toolbox ecosystem through an online collaborative platform called **GitHub**. GitHub stores the **R** scripts and *.csv* files in a folder called a repository, which is found online and can also be downloaded on your computer and synced with the online version. GitHub tracks changes by all collaborators working on the project through time, and saves all versions for comparison. The section, "**Installing the Toolbox**," provides instruction on how to download GitHub repositories to your computer, but everything is also available online.  

The Toolbox is used to calculate final scores. But, perhaps more importantly, it can also be used to organize an assessment, including data identification and management.  The Toolbox can additionally be used to compare how different management scenarios could affect overall ocean health, which can inform effective strategies for ocean resource management at a local scale.
