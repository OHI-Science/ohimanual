###ICONIC SPECIES
##Practical Considerations

###*Ideal Approach*:

Ideally, data would be available on all species that are important to coastal communities, and then a separate assessments would judge the condition of each of the populations. Because almost any species can be iconic to someone, defining which species are culturally iconic can be challenging; information can sometimes be found from local customs and experts, oral tradition, sociological or anthropological literature, journalism and regional assessments. The type of reference point used will depend on the data available.


###Comparing SPP and ICO

General Issue: SPP and ICO use different models for the OHI eez analyses (but not for HS and Ant).  We are exploring whether we should modify the SPP or ICO model.

ICO status is calculated by taking the average of the IUCN ratings for all the iconic species in the eez.  

SPP status takes into account the IUCN score and the area that the species occupies (although the results are not exactly equivalent to an area weighted average).  Specifically, the values are calculated at the spatial scale of the raster cells (which I believe is at 0.5 degree resolution).  For each raster cell, the IUCN scores of the species are averaged to get a score. To get status, the raster cell scores within an EEZ are then averaged (after weighting for the area of the raster cell).  

### The SPP (cell-averaging) method of calculating status
The original logic was to represent the species present relative to the proportion of their range within a given EEZ.  We may also have wanted to avoid penalizing a region too heavily if only a very small portion of the range came from a very threatened species.  I think we were also worried about bad aqua maps data that could misallocate species into a country and having a big effect.

A disadvantage is that rare species (and those with contracting ranges) will have a relatively small influence on the score.  Common species will, in most cases, drive the results.

An advantage is (actually a disadvantage of averaging species scores at the eez level): "The bigger an area, the more likely you are to find rare at risk species (the classic problem of species-area relationships or SARs) - so bigger countries would have lower diversity scores just as a function of their size but not actual poorer biodiversity. In regards to sampling effort, the number of rare species increases faster than the number of common species, so they would not even each other out."

### Current plan
For now, we are going to calculate SPP using both methods and evaluate (or present both).

**History of the Approach (lessons learned 2014)**
<!---Taken from Conceptual Guide v2--->

Iconic Species
Iconic species are those that are relevant to local cultural identity through a species’ relationship to one or more of the following: 1) traditional activities such as fishing, hunting or commerce; 2) local ethnic or religious practices; 3) existence value; and 4) locally-recognized aesthetic value (e.g., touristic attractions/common subjects for art such as whales).
Model description

**Global 2012:**
Status of this sub-goal is the average extinction risk of iconic species, calculated as the weighted sum of the number of species in each threat category, where an increasing weight is assigned by level of extinction risk of the threat category. This formula penalizes the gravity and number of species endangered among those recognized as iconic.
Global 2013:
Same as Global 2012.

**Brazil:**
Same as Global 2012.

**US West Coast:**
To assess the status of these iconic species within the region we used the same methods outlined in Global 2012, but replaced the global IUCN risk assessments with regionally specific species assessments provided by NatureServe.

####Evolution of the approach:

**Global 2012:**
To define the list of iconic species for each region, we compiled lists of region-specific iconic species combined with lists of globally-recognized iconic species to create the total list of iconic species per region (see ‘Iconic species’ in section 7). Species were drawn from the World Wildlife Fund’s global and regional lists for Priority Species (especially important to people for their health, livelihoods, and/or culture) and Flagship Species (‘charismatic’ and/or well-known). Ultimately, almost any species can be iconic to someone, and so the intent with this goal was to focus on those species widely seen as iconic from a cultural or existence value (rather than for a livelihoods or extractive reason). Many lists exist for globally important, threatened, endemic, etc. species, but in all cases it is not clear if or to what extent these species represent culturally iconic species. The lists we used from World Wildlife Fund are the only source that included cultural reasons for listing iconic species but they only cover a few regions and by no means capture the rich diversity of species that are iconic for local regions, communities, religions, tribes or other groups elsewhere.  Collecting data at those scales would be a very important advance forward.

Habitat-forming species are not included in this definition of iconic species, nor are species that are harvested solely for economic or utilitarian purposes (even though they may be iconic to a sector or individual).

**Global 2013:**
Same as Global 2012.

**Brazil:**
Same as Global 2012.

**US West Coast:**
Same as Global 2012, with regional data for the threat categories.

####The reference point:

**Global 2012:**
The reference point is to have the risk status of all assessed species as Least Concern, meaning that the species is at lowest risk of extinction.  Species that either have not been assessed or are labeled as data deficient are not included in the calculation.

**Global 2013:**
Same as Global 2012.

**Brazil:**
Same as Global 2012.

**US West Coast:**
Same as Global 2012.

####Interpreting a score:
A score of 100 would indicate that all species are in the threat category equivalent to ‘least concern’.
