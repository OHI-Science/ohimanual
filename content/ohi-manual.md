# What is OHI+?

> Your assessment will be an example of independent Ocean Health Index+ assessment (OHI+). At this stage, you should have **Learned** and **Planned** for your assessment, and are now ready to **Conduct** it.

The Ocean Health Index framework presents a highly tailorable approach ready to meet the needs and priorities of those who wish to use the ocean sustainably. Here you will learn how to conduct an Ocean Health Index+ (OHI+) assessment.  The OHI+ approach adds relevant inputs and information to the overarching OHI framework and consists of data and indicators that are specific to the local context. Because the methods of the framework are repeatable, transparent, quantitative, and goal-driven, repeated assessments are valuable because they can be used to tack and monitor the progress of ocean health through time. Even if yours is a first effort, your OHI+ is valuable because it establishes a monitoring baseline and calls attention to the state of the data quality and availability in your area. Such a flexible approach allows OHI+ assessments to adapt to local conditions while still being useful for management.

> Remember that when conducting an assessment, the process is just as valuable as the results.

The Index is an assessment tool that provides a common platform for scientifically combining and comparing key elements from all dimensions of the oceans health — biological, physical, economic, and social – to measure how sustainably people are using the ocean. By allowing for a comprehensive and integrated view of marine systems as a way to understand the trade-offs and synergies among these goals, the Index represents a significant advance over conventional single-sector approaches to assessing sustainability as communicated through other kinds of index efforts. Because of this, preparing the conducting phase will require careful thought, consideration, and documentation, throughout this process.

### The Process of OHI+

The OHI+ process consists of four distinct phases. In the first phase, you **learned** about the OHI and understood the philosophy behind it and the motivation for conducting your study. In the second phase, you actively **planned** to conduct an OHI+ Assessment. Now, in the third phase, you will **conduct** the assessment by engaging with the science of finding the data, preparing the goal models, and taking the necessary steps to learn the software and produce the results. In the final phase, you will communicate the results of your OHI+ Assessment in order to inform stakeholders who will use its findings.

- >**Phase 1:** **Learn** about the OHI
- >**Phase 2:** **Plan** an OHI+ Assessment
- **Phase 3:** **Conduct** the OH+ Assessment
- >**Phase 4:** **Communicate** and Inform

#### What to expect when conducting an assessment
<!---From Conducting_assessment--->
There are key considerations and processes that will be a part of every assessment, however, the process for conducting each assessment will be unique depending on the local context. For example: what data and indicators are available will determine how goal models can be tailored to the region, and what skillsets and resources are involved will affect the time it takes to complete the assessment.

> In OHI+,it is important for your team doing the study to make the decisions and modifications that are most important for the region, and then defend it clearly what was done and why. At the same, your team should  as creative and insightful as you can be.

#### Where to start when conducting an assessment

You should start by understanding the structure of the global assessment and the data involved will help you think about what should be done differently in your local context.  

The best way to do this is to begin with the WebApps. As described in the section, "**Overview of the OHI WebApp**," most coastal countries have a WebApp that was created to facilitate planning and communication during your assessment. The WebApp presents data, goal models and calculated scores for each region (global administrative area identified by http://gadm.org) visually through maps, histograms, and tables. All data presented were extracted from the global analysis, and scores were calculated using global goal models. For a finer-scale assessment of ocean health in your region, these data files provided will need to be updated with available data and indicators for each region in your assessment. However, if better data are not available, you can use the data provided. Then, to dive deeper into data layers and goal models, you can explore your assessment's GitHub repository, which stores all the information presented through the WebApp.  

You should also be familiar with the approaches taken by other assessments adapted from the global context, including Brazil, the US West Coast, and Fiji. You can find these studies at http://ohi-science.org.  

While our team of scientists and managers is prepared to provide guidance for assessments, you should follow the steps in this training program to complete your assessment as autonomously as possible.

### Expected outcomes

**The process of conducting an OHI assessment is as valuable as the final results.** This is because while conducting an OHI assessment you will identify gaps in knowledge and data, produce decision-relevant information, and create an ocean alliance that combines knowledge and cultural values across disciplines. Conducting an OHI assessment requires engagement from as many different groups as possible, including research institutions, government agencies, policy groups, non-governmental organizations, and the civil and private sectors.  

**Finding the best data and indicators available is crucial for obtaining meaningful findings that can help inform decision-making.**  Assessments can incorporate higher-resolution data and indicators, local priorities and preferences, and develop tailored goal models and reference points, which produce scores that better reflect local realities. If a goal is not relevant in the local context, it can be excluded entirely. When you change goal models, though, it is important to capture the process in order to justify decisions that will inform the results. Similarly, pressures and resilience measures can be refined using local data and indicators. Index scores are only as good as the data on which they are based.

# Overview of the OHI WebApp

>**Section Summary:**

>In this section, you will get an introduction to the OHI WebApps. When using the WebApp, you can conduct a preliminary assessment and use the built-in functions to compare input layers,  output scores, and change data display options. You will return to the WebApp at the end of this phase.

> OHI WebApps serve several purposes because they:

> * allow for exploration of how the Index works: what data look like and which data layers are used in each goal
* are a communication platform for an assessment team, since information is presented in a manner that is accessible to group members of different disciplines and technical capacities
* can be used to set data gathering or goal model development priorities for the assessment
* display your assessment’s data and calculated scores once you have finalized and formatted your data and modified goal models.  

## Background

**OHI WebApps** are websites created to facilitate independent assessments, and one is available for nearly every coastal nation or territory. The WebApps are meant to be a ‘Starter Kit’ and are available through http://ohi-science.org using a three-letter identifier in the URL. For example, Ecuador’s WebApp ("ECU") is found at http://ohi-science.org/ecu.
Each WebApp displays data layers\*, which are raw data in this case, as well as the calculated OHI scores based on information extracted from global assessments. As such, they do not provide fine-scale resolution of data for each coastal nation or territory: the scores and data on which they are based are a starting point for an assessment to be conducted by an independent group. These data can be used as a default if better data for the region do not exist, but we encourage you to replace them wherever possible. (\*Note: each data component that is included in the OHI is called a **data layer** because it will be combined with others to calculate the goal scores. Many data layers are rescaled from 0-1 to be combined with  other data layers on the same unitless scale.)  
Boundaries for exclusive economic zones (EEZs) were identified by http://www.marineregions.org and the largest subcountry regions (i.e., provinces, states, districts) were identified by http://gadm.org. Subcountry region boundaries were extended offshore to divide the EEZ of each study area into offshore regions. These subcountry regions have been provided as a starting point, and are typically coastal states or provinces, which, in our experience, is consistent with the scale at which most policy decisions are made. However, it is possible to change the boundaries for the regions and the study area depending on your preferences.

> Note that the OHI+ team doesn't take a stance on disputed territories. For independent assessments, we defer to the map-providers and the best judgment of the technical team.  

The information displayed on the website is stored online, in a **GitHub repository.** GitHub is an open-source development platform allows for multiple users to collaborate, track changes, and document work such as data files and code. Therefore, any changes made to the files contained within the GitHub repository will be displayed on the WebApp for all team members to view. (See the section on **GitHub** for how to modify files using that platform).

## Using the WebApp

> When your team has finalized data layers and updated goal models, these data and scores will be visualized through the WebApp.

When first exploring a WebApp (for example, http://ohi-science.org/ecu), first note that it is possible to **translate** the site into any language that Google provides using the pull-down menu at the top. This will help with communication among your team. 

![The WebApp start page. Note that it's possible to translate the page into your language of choice.](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/11Gojqw0Xz4kUo_uM1Y699EKO3qN_dae0w93ICzXJ2Pg/pub?w=960&h=720)

The WebApp homepage provides several tabs for you to explore. The interactive **App** sub-page allows you to explore input data layers and output calculated scores for each region (See **Overview of Variable Options**). More detailed information is about the default **regions** and **data layers**, **goal models**, and **calculated scores** based on global data can be viewed in separate tabs, as well as through the App page.
A quick reference about navigating the WebApp is available through the **Docs** link at the bottom of the page.

## The App Page

The App page allows you to explore and visualize input data layers and calculated output scores for each region in the study area. By default, global data are presented for each subcountry region in the study area, and scores are calculated for each region using those data.  

The App  page displays this information through two tabs: Data and Compare. The **Data** tab provides several subtabs for viewing data (*Map*, *Histogram*, *Table*), and is the default tab when the Toolbox is launched. The **Compare** tab is most useful for comparing output scores when modifications are made to the underlying data or models (this provides a way to error check) once you have begun the process of calculating your own assessment.  

The App provides two Branch/Scenario options to view, identified in the upper-left corner of the Data tab. The **Branch** options refer to the versions of the GitHub repository where data are stored. Branches start off as copies of the same repository, but can be modified independently of each other, enabling progress to be made on one (‘draft’ branch) while not altering the vetted original (‘published’ branch). These branches can be merged back together at any time. The App page will display the ‘published branch’ by default; we recommend working on the ‘draft’ branch until your assessment is finalized, at which point you would merge the draft branch with the published branch.  

**Scenario** folders contain all the files needed to calculate scores. Scenario folders can differ from each other based on the years included (i.e., 2014 would be a different scenario from 2015), or they can be used to explore outcomes of policy alternatives, such as implementation of a proposed Marine Protected Area network or fisheries regulations. Running these different scenarios can be very useful for an OHI+ assessment in which multiple outcomes are to be evaluated.


## The App's Data tab

### Overview of display options

The Data tab displays input data layer or calculated scores for each goal parameter, and presents the information as a map, histogram, or table. These options (*Map*, *Histogram*, *Table*) are presented as subtabs located the map. The Map subtab is the default display option for the Data tab, and all data presented are drawn from data from the Global Assessments. This means they are either directly duplicated, or down-scaled using regional areas or population weightings.


**Data displayed in the Map subtab:**

![The Map subtab. Click on  'Map'  to see a geographic view of your assessment region. Colors indicate scores or values for your input layers or output scores.](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1SzyHRaHqNWyr_6fji5RcY-nYtN5x5HSTjSgl4tFty44/pub?w=959&h=405)

The map displays data for every region as reported in the scenario. A color legend is displayed in the lower right corner of the map. The range of values will change as different variables are selected, and the colors will automatically change to create a visual scale of reference.


**Data displayed in the Histogram subtab:**

![Click on 'Histogram' to see the distribution of your data or scores, after selecting a variable layer on the left. This example shows the Species sub-goal scores for the study regions of Ecuador.](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/10TGLNEWQpGcUHeLwT06kJUSUcMEa2tb1IwFaauf6Fmk/pub?w=959&h=415)

The histogram shows the distribution of the selected variable as the number of observations per value bin (white bars) and a smoothed density function (pink shading).


**Data displayed in the Table subtab:**

![Click on 'Table' to see a table of your data or scores, after selecting a variable layer on the left. This example shows the Species sub-goal scores for the study regions of Ecuador.](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12CC5Q7YXweoKw39lHkRjBGcoEVsw3bWuuJPVdzxFRAc/pub?w=960&h=419)

The table displays the target value for each region and the overall study area. It provides an identifying code (*rgn_id*), name (*rgn_name*), and value (*value*) for each.


### Overview of variable options

The Data tab has drop-down menus from which  you choose the data to be displayed. Data selected from the pull-down menus can be viewed in Map, Histogram, or Table form as described in the section above. Descriptions, statistics and metadata for the chosen fields are also displayed below the drop-down menus on the left side of the tab.

![Overview of the Data tab. Choose the variable you would like to explore through the drop-down menus on the left-hand side of the page. Once you select either raw data or a score, you can view a description and statistical summary below.](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/17YGGl8ZGa7vB7MJTLGwCOL6yh2Ap-OZOK9iVsI-ez4M/pub?w=960&h=374)

> TIP: Remember that your descriptions and values in `layers.csv` will appear here.

The first selection to be made from the drop-down menus is variable type, in which you can choose the **Output Score** that will show a calculated score (for a particular target chosen subsequently), or **Input Layer** that will show the data layer used to calculate the score of a particular target. To reiterate, Output Scores are the scores calculated using the Input Layers (data layers).  

For example, if you select ‘Output Score’ as the variable type (which is the default), you will then be able to choose a target (goal or sub-goal), and the OHI dimension to be reported.  

As another example, if you select 'Input Layer' as the variable type, you will be able to choose a target and a specific data layer associated with that target. If that layer has multiple categories or years available, you will be able to select a preference. Without selection, the default setting is the first category alphabetically and the most recent year.


![](./fig/overview_variable_options2.png)

## The App’s Compare tab

The **Compare** tab allows you to compare differences in calculated scores based on changes you have made to the underlying data layers. Visualizing these differences is extremely helpful for confirming results and error checking. More context on the use of this function can be found in the section, "**The Ocean Health Index Toolbox**."<!--- develop. Removed line on 'instructions' for this functionality, so might want to include discussion of that elsewhere --->

## Discovering and Gathering Appropriate Data and Indicators

The OHI spans disciplines and integrates diverse data to give a comprehensive assessment of ocean health. A hallmark of the OHI is that it uses freely-available, existing data and indicators to create models that capture the philosophy of individual goals, and finding appropriate data requires good problem-solving abilities. There are many decisions to make when gathering from disparate sources, identifying good proxies and indicators, deciding reference points, and developing goal models.

** The accuracy of Index scores is a reflection of input data quality and the degree of understanding of the study area, and thus including the best quality and appropriate data and indicators available is of highest importance.**

Because the data and indicators you use will come from different sources and available from online databases, reports, spreadsheets and text files, they will also have different formatting. To include these data and indicators in your assessment, you will need to process these files into the format required by the Toolbox, which is explained in the section, **Formatting Data for the Toolbox**. When data have been prepared and formatted for the Toolbox, we call it a **data layer.** Because creating data layers can be quite time-intensive, data should only be prepared for the Toolbox after final decisions have been made to include the data or indicator in your assessment, and after the appropriate goal model and reference points have been finalized.  

There are many data layers included in the OHI framework. There are about eighty individual data layers from the global assessment that should be replaced with higher-resolution data in your study area where possible. You will need to search for data used to calculate status models as well as pressures and resilience layers.  

### Data sources

Existing data and indicators can be gathered from many sources across environmental, social, and economic disciplines, including:

* government reports and project websites
* peer-reviewed literature
* masters and PhD theses
* university websites
* non-profit organizations  

All data must be rescaled to specific reference points (targets) before being combined with the Toolbox; therefore setting these reference points at the appropriate scale is a fundamental component of any OHI assessment. This requires your assessment team to interpret the philosophy of each Index goal and sub-goal using the best available data and indicators. Some indicators already are scaled (e.g., from 0-1 or 0-10), and can easily be incorporated into your assessment since the reference points have already been identified.

### Gathering responsibilities

Gathering appropriate data requires searching for and accessing existing data. You do not have to go collect the data itself, but you do need to discover and acquire existing data. It is important that team members responsible for data discovery make thoughtful decisions about whether data are appropriate for the assessment, and that they get feedback from the full team to discuss the merits of different data sources. Data discovery and acquisition are typically an iterative process, as there are both practical and philosophical reasons for including or excluding data.  

When you begin exploring data possibilities, you can seek local data sources that could directly replace data from the global assessment provided in your repository. Such data would be better quality, i.e., higher accuracy and spatio-temporal resolution, than the data from the global assessment, and models may not need to change. However, we recommend first exploring other data possibilities that could capture specific characteristics to your study area. Assessments conducted at smaller scales are an opportunity to include characteristics specific to your study area that were not captured in the global assessment.

### The process of discovery

The most important thing to remember when gathering data and indicators is that they must contribute to measuring ocean health. Not all information that enhances our knowledge of marine processes directly convey information about ocean health and may not be appropriate within the OHI framework. Because of this, compiled indicators can sometimes be more suitable than raw data measuring single marine attributes.  

Begin by understanding and comparing the best approaches used in assessments that have been completed, including global assessments, Brazil, Fiji, and the US West Coast. For OHI+ assessments, if finer-resolution local data were available in the study area, these data were either incorporated into modified goal models that used locally appropriate and informed approaches or into the existing global goal model. When local data were not available, the global-scale data and global goal models were used, which is least desirable because it does not provide more information than the global study. When looking for data, the following decision tree may be useful.

 This should be a goal-by-goal process:


![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1bJ3lk0stX78YM_VVR8VDAmdVUcMv4riSZk-0L2x8ybw/pub?w=624&h=336)

### Requirements for data and indicators

There are six requirements to remember when investigating (or ‘scoping’) potential data and indicators. It is important that data satisfy as many of these requirements as possible, at times requiring gap-filling solutions. If requirements are not met and gap-filling solutions are not possible, you will likely need to exclude a dataset from the analyses. If data cannot be included, you may elect to use the global data layers or identify other data and a different modeling approach.

1. relevance to ocean health
2. accessibility
3. quality
4. how to set the reference point
5. spatial scale
6. temporal scale


#### Relevance to ocean health  

There must be a clear connection between the data and ocean health, and determining this will be closely linked to each goal model.

#### Accessibility

The two main points regarding accessibility are whether the source is open access and whether the data or indicators will be updated regularly.  

The Index was created in the spirit of transparency and open-access, using open-source software and online platforms such as GitHub, is to ensure as much accessibility and open collaboration as possible. Data and indicators included should also follow these guidelines, so that anyone wishing to understand more about the Index may be able to see what data were used and how. For this reason we emphasize the importance of using data that may be made freely downloadable, as well as the importance of clearly documenting all data sources and reasons for the choices made in selecting data, indicators, and models.  

Index scores can be recalculated annually as new data become available. This can establish a baseline of ocean health and serve as a monitoring mechanism to evaluate the effectiveness of actions and policies in improving the status of overall ocean health. This is good to keep in mind while looking for data: will it be available again in the future? It is also important to document the sources of all data so that it is both transparent where it came from and you will be able to find it in the future.

#### Quality

Understanding how the data or indicators were collected or created is important. Are they collected by a respected organization with quality control? Are there any protocol changes to be aware of, e.g., were there changes in the collection protocol to be aware of when interpreting temporal trends?



#### Reference point  

Most data will need to be scaled to a reference point, as you consider different data sources it is important to think about or identify what a reasonable reference point may be. Ask the following types of questions as you explore data possibilities:  

* Has past research identified potential targets for these data?
  + example: maximum sustainable yield in fisheries
* Have policy targets been set regarding these data?
  + example: maximum levels of pollutants before beach closures
* Would a historic reference point be an appropriate target?
  + example: percent of habitat coverage before coastal development
* Could a region within the study area be set as a spatial reference point?
  + example: a certain region a leader in creating protected areas


#### Appropriate spatial scale

Data must be available for every region within the study area.*

#### Appropriate temporal scale
  Data must be available for at least three to five years to calculate the trend. For some goals, where temporal reference points are desirable, longer time series are preferable.*  

\* It is not always possible to fully meet the spatial and temporal requirements with each source. In these cases, provided that the gaps are not extensive, it can still be possible to use these data if appropriate gap-filling techniques are used (See: 'Formatting Data for Toolbox' section).  

### Example: US West Coast data discovery

Below are examples of some decisions made when exploring available data for the US West Coast assessment. Determining whether certain data could be included began with a solid understanding of the data layers and models included in the global assessment. Since the US West Coast is a data-rich region, finer-resolution local data could be used in place of many of the global data layers. The US West Coast assessment had five regions: Washington, Oregon, Northern California, Central California, and Southern California.


#### Reasons data were excluded  

There are a lot of existing data that contribute to our scientific understanding of ocean processes and interactions but are not ideal for the OHI. Reasons to exclude data are both due to practical requirements (e.g., resolution, coverage, or other requirements that have been listed) and philosophical requirements (i.e., they do not help capture the attributes of interest for assessing ocean health). Some common reasons for excluding data are:  

* **The data do not cover the entire area of the reporting region**. The state of California had excellent, long-term data on public attendance at state parks that would have been quite useful in the calculation of the tourism and recreation goal. However, data were only available for three of the five regions (the three California regions but not Oregon and Washington), so they could not be used.  

* **There is not a clear and scientifically observed relationship between the data and ocean health**. Along the US West Coast, kelp beds are a very important habitat because of their contribution to biodiversity and coastal protection. However, kelp coverage variation and is driven primarily by abiotic natural forcing (wave/storm disturbance and temperature) and thus it is not a good indicator of kelp forest health, particularly in the case of anthropogenic impacts. For these reasons kelp coverage was not included in the assessment.  

* **The feature being measured may provide benefits to people, but this feature is not derived from marine or coastal ecosystems**. Sea walls and riprap provide coastal protection to many people along the US West Coast. However, these structures are not a benefit that is derived from the marine ecosystems, so only coastal habitats were included in the calculation of this goal. These data can be included as a pressure due to habitat loss. They were not used as a resilience measure because they can often have negative side effects (e.g., by altering sedimentation dynamics), and because they have limited long-term sustainability (i.e., they need maintenance).  

* **Data collection is biased and might misrepresent ocean health**. The US Endangered Species Act identifies a species list focused on species of concern within the US. As such, these data are biased in the context of ocean health since they only assess species whose populations may be in danger. For the calculation of the biodiversity goal, using these data would be inappropriate because this goal represents the status of all species in the region, not just those that are currently of conservation concern. Using these data may have shown the status of biodiversity to be lower than it really is because the selection of species to assess was already biased towards species of concern.

* **Time series data are not long enough to calculate a trend or a reference point** (when a historical reference point is most appropriate). For the US West Coast, the current extent of seagrass habitats was available, however, these do not exist for previous points in time in most areas, so could not be used to calculate the trend or set a historical reference point. Therefore, we estimated the trend in health of seagrass habitats using as a proxy the trend in the main stressor (i.e., turbidity). In other words, we assumed that the rate of seagrass loss was directly proportional to the rate of increase in turbidity. Similar solutions may be used to estimate trends in your own assessment, if there is scientific support for assuming that the trend of what we want to assess (or the relationship between the current state and the state in the reference year) has a strong relationship with the trend of the proxy data available.

<!---Option: JSL develop the discussion of searching not only for strict data within your country to use, but studies that have been done anywhere in the world, demonstrating relationships between different things (eg camaroneras effects on mangrove condition)--->

## Best Approaches for Starting an Assessment

The Ocean Health Index team has a gained much knowledge from years of developing the Index. However, with each new independent assessment, the team is learning even more, and we hope to share that information with you and encourage outside dialogue on the best approaches to conducting an Independent Assessment.Your OHI+ assessment will also be invaluable in learning how to develop better and more appropriate techniques to changing goal models.

For goals that have been conducted commonly across OHI+ assessments and the Global Assessment, we provide recommendations for how to approach them broadly here in the Manual. Some broad themes to keep in mind are listed below, followed by practical considerations for each goal model area.

If you haven't already read about the goal philosophies in the OHI **Conceptual Guide**, you should read it before continuing. You should also read about **Assembling a Team** and **Strategy**. These are important first steps in starting an OHI+ assessment. You should also have checked out the WebApp and be familiar with its capabilities to keep your end-goal in mind.

****

**Here are some cross-cutting themes to keep in mind as you conduct your OHI+ assessment:**

#### Think Creatively

Humans interact with and depend upon the oceans in complex ways, some of which are familiar and easy to measure, such as providing seafood, transporting goods, or disposing of waste. Other benefits are more difficult to measure, such as the way marine-related jobs indirectly affect coastal communities, how different habitats mediate storm damage or the benefits people receive or perceive simply from living near the ocean. Thinking creatively and exploring the data available can make the Index more representative of reality.

 It is important to think creatively and beyond the interests of a specific institution or primary field of study. Google or other internet search engines are great starting places: investigate what kinds of information are available from government and public records, scientific literature, academic studies, surveys and reports or other sources.

 Data used in the Ocean Health Index spans a wide array of disciplines, both within and outside of oceanography and marine ecology. Therefore, it is necessary to look beyond the most known or obvious data sources to find data relevant for the goals in the region. Discussions with colleagues, literature searches, emails to experts, and search engines are good ways to understand what kinds of data are collected and to hunt for appropriate data.

#### Search for the Appropriate Data

Any assessment will depend on the available data, which requires creative thinking, particularly when ideal data are unavailable. Determining the appropriate scale and defining the study area and any regions within the study area will also depend on available data. The scale and resolution of available data can help inform the scale of the study area to be analyzed and how to divide it into regions.

Data included to calculate scores are partly based on the philosophical framework of the Ocean Health Index (see Part I), and partly based on data available. Several goals that combine across categories have many potential data sources that could be included (or excluded): in particular the natural products, livelihoods and economies, and habitat based goals. The existence of the data itself will drive a lot of these decisions, but here are some guidelines to help determine if data are appropriate philosophically:

* Do the data represent something truly ocean-based, and natural (i.e. not man-made)?
* How would the reference point be calculated?
* Do data cover the appropriate spatial scales?
* Do data cover the appropriate temporal scales?

#### Think about Spatial Considerations

Here it is important to think about why is there interest in completing an OHI assessment. If managers or policy makers are interested, at what scale do they work? Where are the political boundaries? These questions are important to keep the OHI assessment relevant, but ultimately data availability will be most important in how to define regional boundaries for the OHI.

There are several spatial considerations you should have prepared before moving forward with the Toolbox. One is your map definitions for use in the assessment and in the WebApps. You must define your map regions and boundary. This can be politically drawn or, if appropriate, biogeographically drawn. Biographic considerations may be important when there are disputed territories or boundary lines in your area. *Note that OHI+ does not take a position on disputed territories, so it is up to you to vet the quality of the maps.*

Once you have the maps, you may also need to define buffer zones. Buffers are distances from shore, both inland and offland, that can be used later in the Toolbox to assess many impacts more accurately.

Finally, you will need to prepare your layers folder with spatial data. Only goals certain goals will require data layers that are spatial (see Section, **Habitat-Based Goals**). When considering spatial data, you should be conscientious of how it is presented: is it by square kilometers, or by a kind of region such as an EEZ or other identifier? Do you have better local data than global satellite or modeled data? Once you find the data, consider how far back in time it goes. Can you set a reference point with this data, or do you have to find another dataset or other source of information to find a historical reference point?

> TIP: The only thing to do is remember that you are trying to capture ocean health--too far inland may no longer relate to ocean health.

<!---FIX: Does 1km land buffer make sense in this context? Should they extend this beyond maybe ~5km or more? It just depends on how Ecuadorians define ‘coastal’. Maybe 1km is too much? Maybe not enough? How do people interact with the ocean from onland? Maybe it’s only if you can see the water. Or maybe more. Maybe they could look at cultural sites on land that have been considered coastal and see how many km inland they are. Maybe they should clip as far inland as mangroves go, if these are special places. The only thing to do is remember that you are trying to capture ocean health: too far inland may no longer relate to ocean health. So maybe the idea of a constant buffer is a bad one, and follow the mangrove or saltmarsh lines, combined with other specific special places. But they can also just leave it and not worry about it. Might not be worth bringing up the debate now.
some history: the 1km buffer was used at the global scale because there was spatial data of parks on land, and we needed to exclude ones that didn’t make sense. but since they have a better knowledge of their coastlines and what’s important, they could ditch the buffers and just pick the ones that they know are important coastally.--->

<!---BUFFERS note: a common theme was ‘these are special areas inland, but they’re not considered by the index since they are >1km inland’. us: ‘but you can change that buffer. Define it as is important to you, to your interpretation of ocean health--->

#### Keep Reference Points in Mind
<!---Develop--->
The decisions on choosing a reference point will be a theme in each of the goal models you develop. The choice of a reference point will affect how the final scores are calculated, and will have to be balanced between limitations of the data and expert judgment to assess the conditions of the various dimensions of ocean health.

In addition to set values, such as maximum or minimum observed value, it's possible to use spatial reference points and temporal reference points. In spatial reference points, you find the highest-scoring region and say that it is perfect. It's also possible to set a different reference point for each region of your study area, as was done in the U.S. West Coast study (2014). Using temporal reference points, a historical benchmark is used as a the "ideal" point in the past. A third type of reference point is a policy-set target, such as a sustainable catch yield by a certain year, or the number of people employed in a marine sector by a certain year. In any case, you must balance being realistic with being ambitious. We suggest following the S.M.A.R.T. criteria when choosing a reference point--they should be "Specific," "Measurable," "Ambitious," "Realistic," and "Time-bound."

You will learn more, and think more critically about reference points, as you develop the data layers for your assessment.

## Practical Guidance

### Synergies: Data to Approach Together

Whether you are working goal-by-goal, or data layer by data layer, it is important to consider where you can find synergies in data discovery. For example, while you are looking for data layers for fisheries goals, you may also find data layers for fishing pressures, such as metrics on bycatch or trawling intensity. This will save you time and allow you to start thinking about how to rank pressures and resilience weights on your goals as well. Conceptually, it will help your team build a picture of how your goals are interlocking in a way that is reflective of the actual linkages that exist in the coupled human and natural systems you are studying. Some key examples are listed below, and are further explained in the following sections.

#### Do Habitat-Based Goals Together

You should do the habitat-based goals together. These include **Carbon Storage**, **Coastal Protection**, **Biodiversity: Habitats** in the Global Assessment. This will be more efficient because the spatial analyst can do the data manipulation to create the spatial layers that get used for these goals, based off the same source material. This will greatly expedite your data search, and layer preparation. If you wish to further coordinate these activities on a higher level, you could have the same team member coordinate activities for the development of these three goals.

> If you look at `functions.R`, you will see that the reason this is the case is because the data layer, `Hab_extent`, is used in multiple places in the software:

 * NP
* FIS
* CS
* CP

![Note that Habitat Extent appears in several goal model functions. ](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1HtrwjFi1Lod6B687nNTUPqK-MTAr9uwShooHUIu3Le4/pub?w=790&h=258)

#### Linkages: connections between pressures and goals

You should note the connections between your goals and the pressures and resilience that affect them.

For instance, you should do the fisheries goals and pressures together. The **Wild-Caught Fisheries** model uses functional relationships that rely on catch data, which may lead to information on commercial high- and low-bycatch. Bycatch data are used in the pressures layers and affect other goals such as, **Livelhoods and Economies** and **Biodiversity**, but perhaps not **Food Provision**, and so it will be good to think about those connections as you go through the data discovery process. <!--- @Julie is this the right place for 'the idea of greedy goals'?--->

Another example is how climate change impacts will appear in your assessment. Climate change pressures layers can include UV radiation, Sea Surface Temperature (SST), sea-level rise (SLR), ocean acidification. These impacts might affect such goals as **Natural Products**, **Carbon Storage**, **Coastal Protection**, **Sense of Place**, **Livelihoods and Economies**, and **Biodiversity**.

In the case of Global 2012, the **Clean Waters** goal is very much linked to the pressures because the same data layers for pressures are used as the input layers for the status. Note that because trash is also a pressure, it affects other goals as well, including **Tourism and Reacreation**, **Lasting Special Places**, **Livelihoods and Economies,** and **Species**.

These connections will become more clear as you go through the OHI+ assessment process.

### Practical Considerations for Habitat-based Goals

> Habitat-based goals can be approached together in the data gathering process. Habitats appear in such goals as **Carbon Storage**, **Coastal Protection**, and **Biodiversity**. Your approach will largely depend on the type of data you have.

*Ideal Approach*

Ideally, information on the extent and condition of every single habitat type would be available. The reference point for habitat-based goals will likely be temporal. This means that historic data are needed such that current habitat and value data can be compared to historic data. This could also be achieved by using or a proportion of historic data.

*Practical Guidance*

The first thing to consider with habitats is **what habitats are in your area**. You should consider what habitats are in your coastal regions as well as your offshore regions throughout your EEZ. Are there mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass beds, salt marshes, sea ice, or subtidal soft-bottom habitats? Are there kelp forests in your waters?

Once you determine what habitats are in your area, you should also consider **their range extent within your reporting regions**. You should consider whether and how far they go offshore and inland. You will likely use a combination of clipped spatial data and spatial data for whole regions, depending on the goal being assessed. For instance, the **Habitat** sub-goal of **Biodiversity** uses the entire region for habitats such as coral reefs in the calculation, but the **Coastal Protection** only uses the extent to 1 kilometer offshore and inland to 1 kilometer <!---Check---> This will affect the preparation of the spatial data layers later in you assessment.

> For instance, do mangroves occur in river deltas in your area, and if so, how far upriver do they go? In the 2013 Global Assessment, for example, mangrove was assessed from 1 kilometer offshore to 1 kilometer inland, but this distance is variable and could change for you OHI+ assessments. It depends on your geography.

Several factors for habitats will have to be considered. In score calculations, habitats are weighted in different ways based on the amount of protection they provide and the amount carbon they sequester, and they are also derived from estimations of habitat health and condition (See **Carbon Storage**, **Coastal Protection**, and **Biodiversity**). The weights of the habitats relative to each other comes from the literature. If you have access to regional-specific studies, you should use try to use that information. Otherwise, the Global data layers can be used as a secondary option.

When thinking about condition, for instance, coral health is based on the percentage of "living cover" on a reef relative to the potential range of the reef.

> In the Global Assessment, coral reference points used the mean predicted values for a country from 1985-1987. When this data was not available for a country, we used the value of neighboring countries. There was also some analyses to control for the fact that the % live coral cover naturally varies over time, hence the use of "predicted values".

> In the 2012 Global Assessment, soft-bottom habitat had an estimated status based on the "intensity of trawl fishing" as a proxy.

It is also important to think about the temporal aspect of your habitats. This will affect the **trend** and the choice of the **reference point**. Trend is the change in health or condition over time. However, this might be constrained by data availability due to the heterogeneity of habitat types and data sources. Ideally, there will be enough years of data to directly calculate the recent change in health of the habitat by using a linear model to calculate trend. This isn't always the case, and proxies or estimates might need to be used. For example, due to spotty salt marsh data we created trend categories of increasing (0.5), stable (0), and decreasing (-0.5) based on available data.

> For example, for sea ice in the Global Assessment, a linear model was set to a metric of sea ice cover for data from 2006-2011, after some smoothing to account for natural variation.

Overall, the historical **reference point** is particularly important for the habitat goals. What's the ideal reference point, however? You could consider setting the reference point further back in history if you have the data for it. This would assume there was a more pristine condition in the past, and would be based on the assumption that habitat destruction has been and still is occurring. Here it is useful to use the S.M.A.R.T. principles (See **Conceptual Guide**). It is highly encouraged to set an ambitious reference point, and deviate from those which were set in the Global.

****

#### Ready to start the **Carbon Storage** goal?

*Ideal Approach*

Ideally,  information would be available to allow you to to assess the amount of carbon stored in every coastal habitat in your area. The best information would show area covered and some measure of the quality of the habitat for this goal. For example, a dense mangrove forest would be better quality than a sparse mangrove forest. Additionally, different weights would be assigned to the habitats based on their relative ability to store carbon, and this factor could be used to penalize areas where there is greater loss of carbon and reward areas where this is a greater storage of carbon. The carbon storage model could then incorporate such weights in a similar way to the **Coastal Protection** goal. The reference point for habitat-based goals will likely be temporal in most cases. This means that historic data are needed so that current habitat values can be compared to a past state.

>TIP: Understanding habitat carbon storage rates is an area of ongoing research. The capacity for habitats to store carbon varies, and depends on the morphology of plants in the system.

*Practical Guidance*

The model and approach for **Carbon Storage** developed for the Global assessment will likely be appropriate for independent assessments. Knowing the area and the condition of of carbon-storing habitats are the two components that are most important. It is important to spend time looking for a way to quantify condition, but it may not be possible to find.

One of the first decisions for your team to make is **whether to use the given data** in the Global Assessments or **to find and use a better dataset**. Even though your goal model shouldn't change entirely from the Global, you should find more localized data than the global data, because the global data layers have already been processed and include clipped regions that reduce the specificity of the information for your area. This is because in the default WebApp methods, the habitat area was calculated by using the global areal coverage of the habitat weighted by the size of the offshore area of the region. This is not consistent currently in the WebApps; for example, if you look at [the given layers a WebApp](https://github.com/OHI-Science/col/blob/draft/subcountry2014/layers/hab_extent_gl2014.csv), you will see that the same values are applied to all regions. You should think here, however, of how your regions' size compare to any spatial dataset's scale, and return to the question of spatial coverage once you are thinking about the **reference points** farther on.

> Questions to consider: Do you have maps, for example, that show current habitat distributions and maps that show historical habitat distributions?  If so, you could extract that data for each of your regions to get a current and reference area. You could also use summarized habitat data that exists in tables or are already compiled in another source.

The types of habitat data you search for also matter. It is recommended to search for mangroves, saltmarshes, and sea grasses because these are viewed as carbon-sequestering habitats that are both ecologically threatened and sensitive to policy responses.  You should remember that we recommend using habitats that can store carbon on the order of 100 years, thereby limiting the types of habitat types you will need. This would also affect other kinds of indicator considerations not discussed in the Global Assessments, such as chlorophyll abundance.

> TIP:, if you look at your default data on the WebApp, you will see **Carbon Storage** information presented for **mangroves**, **salt marshes**, and **sea grass** even if there are no mangroves in your area. You will not be scored on these if they are not in your area.

The second group of items to consider are the **condition** and **carbon contribution**. **Condition** is more essential than **contribution** in this case because it is a more direct measure of ecosystem health and would give a more accurate score for this goal. **Condition** means . It can be measured by a number of ways, often indirectly through studies on density of the habitats, disease affecting the particular habitats, or other impacts such as change in species composition or growth rates from impacts such as overgrazing. Has there been a study assessing habitat integrity or health specifically in your area? **Contribution** is how much each habitat stores relatively to the others--such as the rates of carbon uptake as measured by empirical data. For this you would have to go to the literature and find ratios of organic nutrient uptake between habitats, and you would have to make sure these studies are done correctly to represent your area. For example, were the studies done with a young mangrove forest, or an older one, which might have different growth rates?

> In the 2012 Global Assessment, the condition of mangroves was assessed as, "Current square kilometers of mangrove coverage divided by the reference hectares, calculated from 1980 to 2005. Seagrass condition was calculated as, "Current percent cover, or hectares, of habitat divided by the reference percentage cover, or hectares from 1975 to 2010."  <!---See Table S7, Supplementary Information, Halpern et al. 2012, p. 24. Note that interestingly it does say salt marsh "condition" was calculated by an increasing or stable trend (value = 1), or by a decreasing trend (value = 0.5). Excluded it because it seems like an estimation.--->

A vital consideration for this goal is **the reference point**. It is an important decision to be made based on good science given the limitations of available data. The reference point is the extent of the habitat at some time in the past, in other words the ideal condition. You will need historical data for this--either from satellites, published papers, or even hand-drawn maps. For questions of sustainability, you must consider, what is a good year to set as your historical past extent? The reference year should be identified based on SMART principles, particularly that it is an ambitious goal, but also realistic. If you do not have trend data, you will have to use a proxy for the trend.

> In the U.S. West Coast assessment (2014), researchers went to the local public library to find hand-drawn maps of historical salt marsh extents in California.

In this case, perhaps your choice of historical reference point may be guided by a policy target as well. For example, are there any climate change policies in your area, with defined targets and objectives? Are there any restoration or carbon storage projects in your area? Do any organizations offer guidance on the amount of carbon storage your management policies should be aiming for?

#### Ready to start on **Coastal Protection**?

> **Coastal Protection** aims to assess the amount of protection provided by marine and coastal habitats against flooding and erosion to coastal areas that people value.

*Ideal Approach*

Ideally, data for all habitats within a region would be available, as well as information on the value of the land and the vulnerability of inhabitants being protected by these habitats. This requires data for habitat type at high spatial resolution  as well as a measure of the value of what is protected by the habitats. The reference point for habitat-based goals will likely be a temporal baseline; this means that historic data are needed such that current habitat and value data can be compared to them.

*Practical Guidance*

The areas relevant to this goal include both inhabited places, such as homes and other structures, and uninhabited places such as parks and special places. However, no credit is given for sea-walls, because they are not regarded as sustainable. At local and regional scales data may exist on all these variables at a high enough resolution to map and calculate exactly which habitats are providing how much protection to which coastal areas. You must first decide which data sources to use for your maps. Do you have spatially-explicit satellite data? If so, how far back in time does it go? The data consideration will be a consideration when you set the reference points.

> In the U.S. West Coast assessment (2014), researchers went to the local public library to find hand-drawn maps of historical sand-dunes in California, for example, in order to find information for sand dune extent in the 1850s.

In addition, one might want to know the level of vulnerability of the different coastal communities. Vulnerability can be quantified as the ability to evacuate, fragility of constructions, economic ability to reconstruct in case of damage. The the reason this is done is to prioritize the protection of certain locations. Physical properties may be available in regional studies, allowing for more a detailed understanding of the protective ability, and likelihood of exposure for each habitat type in different portions of the coastline.

As with the other habitat-based goals, you will need to make careful decisions about your reference point. It's an important decision to be made based on good science given the limitations of available data. The reference point is the extent of the habitat at some time in the past, in other words the ideal condition. You will need historical data for this--either from satellites, published papers, or even hand-drawn maps. For questions of sustainability, you must consider, what is a good year to set as your historical past extent? Do you want to be ambitious and set it far in the past, so it gets closer to a more "pristine" condition? Or do you want to make it represent human use? Will it make your scores look better or worse if you choose a more recent or more distant example?

#### Linking Habitats and Biodiversity

It is important to think about how habitat relate to the **Biodiversity** goal. The current approach tracks **Species** and **Habitats** separately because of imperfect data for **Species**. In other words, habitats are an estimation of the health of the species in an area. Therefore if you have comprehensive species assessments in your area you wouldn’t need the **Habitat** sub-goal. However, the inventory of marine biodiversity may not often be sufficiently complete in your area.

You should also think about the linkages between the habitat-based goals, such as **Carbon Storage** and **Coastal Protection**, and the pressures and resilience. Does the encroachment or reduction of these habitats have an effect on carbon sequestration, or does it change ecosystem composition sufficiently to impact species? Could habitats have an effect on **Clean Waters**, or are they impacted more by local pollution than other impacts? If habitats change for natural reasons, you might not need to worry about their pressures on other goals, but if they consist of introduced species, you should think about the effects on other goals.

> For example, the invasive marsh plants such as *Spartina* may afford some Carbon Storage, but it’s a non-native habitat to an area such as the San Francisco Bay. It could still count towards the **Carbon Storage** goal, but would also be a pressure on **Biodiversity**.


#### History of the Approaches

*Carbon Storage Goal*

Assessment | Model Description and Reference Point | Evolution of Approach | Interpreting a score
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
**Global 2012** | The status of Carbon Storage is measured as a function of its current ‘condition’ relative to a reference condition and a variable that weights the relative contribution of each habitat type to total carbon storage (measured as the amount of area each habitat covers relative to the total area covered by all three habitats given the available data). In Global 2012, the coastal ecosystems assessed were seagrasses, tidal marshes and mangroves.<br  /><br  />Reference conditions were set as the current condition or area of coastal plant habitat coverage relative to that in ~1980. This is not a very ambitious reference point, but the best that the data would allow. | We focused on three coastal habitats known to provide meaningful amounts of carbon storage: mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes. For mangroves, we included the whole extent of the coastal forests, including the parts on land or in river deltas, since these too provide significant additional amounts of carbon storage. | A score of 100 would indicate that the percent cover (and health, when measured) of each habitat had not changed since the date set as reference point (the 1980s or pre-industrial coverage, depending on the assessment used).
**Global 2013** | The goal model and reference point were the same as in Global 2012. There were improvements in data processing were.<br  /><br  />The reference point was the same as Global 2012. | Mangrove data used in the goal model were processed differently than described in Global 2012: data now include 1km inland in addition to 1km offshore. |
**Brazil (2014)** | The goal model was the same as in Global 2012.<br  /><br  />The reference condition was determined specifically for each habitat type. For salt marshes the reference year is 1975. For mangroves, we knew the current (2010) extent per state, but only had a total country extent for the reference year (1980). We apportioned the total reported mangrove extent for Brazil in 1980 by state using a linear regression model that estimates the percent of mangrove loss per state. Data to assess current and reference condition for seagrasses did not meet minimum data requirements: they were available only for three sites in Brazil within the time period 2002-2010 (no data for a reference condition). For this reason, we used available data from adjacent EEZs (countries in the South Atlantic) and used georegional averages as current condition and reference condition values for Brazil. A linear model was fitted to the data for all countries, and the mean of predicted values for 1979-1981 was used as the reference condition, and the mean of predicted values of the three most recent years (2008, 2009, 2010) was used as the current condition. | The same approach was used as in Global 2012, with local data used as available. |
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | We used reconstructions of historic extents compared to current habitat coverage to set more ambitious targets. However, the historical reconstructions did not include information on habitat health so only extent was used in this assessment.<br  /><br  />Reliable, comprehensive habitat extent data prior to the 1990s are unavailable for most coastal regions within the U.S. Estimates of habitat loss since European settlement have been extrapolated in some regions for some habitats. However, while the habitat extent from the 1990s would represent a very un-ambitious target, a pre-industrialized reference point for habitat extent is considered an unrealistic goal under current conditions. To establish our temporal reference points we instead set our reference uniquely for each habitat, as a percentage of pre-industrialized habitat coverage for salt marshes, as habitat extent between the 1950s and 1960s for sand dunes, or utilized pressures on habitats as a proxy of habitat condition for seagrasses and soft bottom habitats. | Only two out of the three habitats considered in the global analysis were included here: salt marshes and seagrass beds. Mangroves are not found in the US West Coast and are not included in this assessment. |

*Coastal Protection Goal*

Assessment | Model Description and Reference Point | Evolution of Approach | Interpreting a score
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
**Global 2012** | The status of this goal was calculated to be a function of the amount and/or condition (depending on data availability) of marine habitat(s) relative to their reference states and the ranked protective ability of each habitat type. Rank weights for the protective ability of each habitat come from previous work that ranks mangroves, corals and sea ice as 4, salt marshes as 3, and seagrasses as 1, where higher values are better.<br  /><br  />The reference point compares the current extent and condition of five key habitats that protect coastlines (mangrove forests, seagrass meadows, salt marshes, tropical coral reefs, and sea ice) from flooding and erosion relative to their condition in the early 1980's. | At global scales, fine-scale habitat data do not exist and so we focused on EEZ-scale assessments, even though this scale does not allow one to account for the spatial configuration of habitats relative to coastal areas and the vulnerability of human coastal communities. Consequently, we assumed that all coastal areas have equal value and equal vulnerability and assessed the total area and condition of key habitats within each EEZ (without regard to their precise location). The habitats that provide protection to coastal areas from inundation and erosion and for which we have global data include mangroves, coral reefs, seagrasses, salt marshes, and sea ice. | A score of 100 would indicate that these habitats are all still intact or have been restored to the reference condition (i.e. their extent during the early 1980’s if using Global 2012, or 50% of their extent for some of the habitats in US West Coast, etc.). Any score below 100 indicates that these habitats have declined in coverage or in health since then, with lower scores indicating more significant declines, and stronger penalties for declines in habitats with high protection ability (e.g. mangroves in Global 2012).
**Global 2013** | The goal model and reference point were the same as in Global 2012. | Same as Global 2012. |
**Brazil (2014)** | Same goal model as Global 2012, using local data.<br  /><br  />To calculate the reference state for coral reef status within Brazil we lacked a minimum of two data points within the time period 1980-1995 (which was considered the acceptable range to use as “reference” years). We therefore estimated the status as the averages of scores from 24 countries within the Caribbean ecoregion that had sufficient coral data. For each of those countries, we fitted a linear model to the data available, pooled across all sampled sites, and we defined the ‘current’ condition (health) as the mean of the predicted values for 2008-2010, and the reference condition as the mean of the predicted values for 1985-1987. | Area was measured for each coastal state as the 12 nmi jurisdiction boundary for each habitat type. For mangroves we focused only on the most coastal portion of mangrove forests as they are the main source of coastal protection. For seagrasses we used the total reported extent of seagrasses in Brazil divided by the coastal area of each state. For coral reefs we calculated the extent per coastal waters of each state using maps of coral reef distribution. The salt marsh extents for Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul states are from national statistics. |
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | Same as Global 2012, with more ambitious reference points for target habitat coverage.<br  /><br  />Reliable, comprehensive habitat extent data prior to the 1990s are unavailable for most coastal regions within the U.S. Estimates of habitat loss since European settlement have been extrapolated in some regions for some habitats. However, while the habitat extent from the 1990s would represent a very un-ambitious target, a pre-industrialized reference point for habitat extent is considered an unrealistic goal under current conditions. To establish our temporal reference points we instead set our reference uniquely for each habitat, as a percentage of pre-industrialized habitat coverage for salt marshes, as habitat extent between the 1950s and 1960s for sand dunes, or utilized pressures on habitats as a proxy of habitat condition for seagrasses and soft bottom habitats. | In the U.S. west coast we measured the role of salt marshes, seagrasses, and sand dunes as these habitats provide the most significant and measurable amount of coastal protection and had data available to include. |

*Habitat sub-goal of Biodiversity*

Assessment | Model Description and Reference Point | Evolution of Approach | Interpreting a score
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
**Global 2012** | The status of the Habitat sub-goal was assessed for all habitats for which at least some global data were available, specifically: mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass beds, salt marshes, sea ice edge, and subtidal soft-bottom habitats. Status was assessed as the average of the condition estimates for each habitat present in a region.<br  /><br  />In the global study, the current condition of salt marshes, seagrasses, mangroves and corals was compared to a reference year that is intended to represent optimal conditions (1980 for salt marshes and sand dunes, varied by site for seagrasses). We generally considered the reference years to be between 1980-1995 and the current years to be between 2001-2010, although these varied by habitat due to data availability. | A significant amount of pre-processing of the habitat data was needed to fill data gaps and resolve data quality issues (see the data layers section for details on data sources). Because consistent habitat monitoring data were unavailable for many regions, anomalous values can occur. | A score of 100 would indicate that habitat coverage had not reduced when compared to the temporal reference point.
**Global 2013** | The goal model and reference point were the same as Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2013. |
**Brazil (2014)** | The goal model was the same as as Global 2012 for mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass beds, salt marshes, and subtidal soft-bottom habitats.<br  /><br  />The timeframes between current and reference condition vary across habitats, but we generally used a 20-year gap. However, it is important to bear in mind that we were able to obtain only a few time-series in which habitat health was resampled through time, so that information from a few point estimates had to be used to infer the health of a large and highly heterogeneous region. | The approach was the same as Global 2012. |
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | Same as Global 2012 for salt marshes, seagrasses, sand dunes, and soft-bottom habitats. Additionally, when assessing habitat condition, we used reconstructions of historic extents to set more ambitious targets.<br  /><br  />To establish our temporal reference points we instead set our reference uniquely for each habitat, as a percentage of pre-industrialized habitat coverage for salt marshes, as habitat extent between the 1950s and 1960s for sand dunes, or we utilized pressures on habitats as a proxy of habitat condition for seagrasses and soft bottom habitats. | Reliable, comprehensive habitat extent data prior to the 1990s are unavailable for most coastal regions within the U.S. Estimates of habitat loss since European settlement have been extrapolated in some regions for some habitats. However, while the habitat extent from the 1990s would represent a very un-ambitious target, a pre-industrialized reference point for habitat extent is considered an unrealistic goal under current conditions. To establish our temporal reference points we instead set our reference uniquely for each habitat, as a percentage of pre-industrialized habitat coverage for salt marshes; and as habitat extent between the 1950s and 1960s for sand dunes. We utilized pressures on habitats as a proxy of habitat condition for seagrasses and soft bottom habitats. |

#### Practical Considerations for Species Goals

#### Comparing **Biodiversity, Species** and **Iconic Species**

> In the Global Assessments, the **Species** sub-goal for **Biodiversity** and the **Iconic Species** sub-goal for **Lasting Places** make use of related data sources.

#### *Ideal Approach*

Ideally, you would find data for all species present in your region including information on their habitat ranges along with scientific studies that speak to the health of their populations. You would also ideally have a list of species that are valued as 'iconic' by coastal communities as a subset of the list of species that are present in your area. Since different species are be iconic to different groups, defining which species are iconic can be challenging when it's a cultural question--you might have to find information from experts or local customs and tradition.

#### Ready to start on species goals?

You should start by trying to **find spatial information for species that occur in your area and determine whether or not they have been scientifically assessed and given a conservation status**. For the **Biodiversity** goal, it is important to note that you can only use species for which there are both spatial data and an assessment. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) provides global species assessments that indicate the conservation status of species. These range from species of "Least Concern" to "Critically Endangered" to "Extinct." You can turn values like as these into numbers and use them as weighting factors in your calculations. You should use unbiased scientific data sources where possible. [AquaMaps](http://aquamaps.org/) offers data for species ranges that have also been used in the Global Assessments. However, good marine species data are lacking at global scale and so wherever there are [spatial data from IUCN](http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/spatial-data), the Global Assessments prefer it over AquaMaps. For regional assessments, local studies of marine species status and local datasets are best here. The spatial information can be a range map with simple presence or absence information, or it can have more detailed data. You can complement the species list search with a scientific literature search to see if anyone has scored the species status in a way that you can use.

>For example, the OHI Antarctic Seas Assessment (2014) assessed thirty-five iconic species. These included bowhead, minke, fin, gray, and humpback whales, and polar bears. Walruses were not included in the High Seas Assessment because they were determined to be data-deficient by the IUCN.

Once you have the full list of assessed species, you need to determine a subset for the **Iconic Species** sub-goal of **Sense of Place**. Choosing iconic species is not a fixed process, so you may have to consider multiple approaches. For instance, are there known "indicator species" in your area? Are there species that are culturally held as valuable? Do any species appear on the currency or postage stamps? In practice, **Iconic Species** are usually a subset of the broader list of species in an area, and so you should be able to find **Iconic Species** after having found assessed species data for the **Species** sub-goal of the **Biodiversity** goal first.

Alternatively, you can figure out which iconic species are present, and then use another kind of assessment approach to see if the populations are healthy, which could be indicated, for instance, by the stability of their populations. The approach you take will depend on the data you find.

> Often, local experts are consulted to determine what **Iconic Species** are in an area. In the Fiji Assessment (2014), regional experts identified thirty-three species. In the U.S. West Coast study (2014), local experts identified seventeen species. You could also pursue more creative approaches way to think about these species. You could think think about what kinds of animals or plants would appear on local stamps, currency, or even flags. In any case, the choice of species has already been made by a community.

The choice of inclusion of iconic species in your list can be a subjective judgment. You could also come up with specific inclusion criteria, for instance, that would filter a list of species or filter a subset of the gathered data for **Biodiversity**, and then you could use this new list in the **Sense of Place** goal. This would be a more rigorous approach because then it could be documented and you could replicate the study in future assessments.

#### Map Considerations

Once you have gathered the data, the treatment of it will matter for the model and goal score calculation. The treatment will be both scientific and philosophical. Do you know how the data were collected? Do you have information on sampling effort? If you don't know, you may not be sure whether changes in condition are due to monitoring efforts or biodiversity change, and you therefore may want to consider the uncertainty of your model.

In any case, the original logic of the **Species** sub-goal of the **Biodiversity** goal is to represent the species present relative to the proportion of their range within a given region. The goal is to summarize extinction risk for an area across assessed species, and assign it appropriately so that the loss of species scores poorly. You should consider whether the impacts to local species status are linear or non-linear. Will drawing borders affect how your scores are assigned? You may also want to avoid making the scores low for a region in the case where a very small portion of the range comes from a highly threatened species, or, you may wish to err on the side of higher caution.

When considering how to change the model, you should think about the outcome of the score on your decisions. For instance, will weighting a "Critically Endangered" species higher on the scale result in the inclusion or exclusion of more rare species? Will the way you aggregate spatial data to summarize extinction risk for your area take into account the influence of species with smaller ranges size, or will that information be lost in the averaging process? An inherent disadvantage for conservation may occur when rare species get rarer in the future, and will therefore have a relatively small influence on the score while common species drive the results.

> Range size has an impact on score results. For example, if you use the current model, none of the cone snail species listed below will have a big impact on the **Species** sub-goal score because to their small range size that covers one cell of map area. However,  the 0.8 score for *Conus roeckeli* shows that it is a rare species as assessed by the IUCN. On the other hand, the coral *Acropora palmata* is also rare and yet covers a large range.

Scientific name | IUCN Category | Trend | Map Cells
---------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|----|
*Conus salreiensis* | Critically Endangered |  Decreasing | 1
*Conus trochulus* |  NearThreatened |  Unknown | 1
*Conus roeckeli* | Least Concern | Unknown | 1
*Acropora palmata* | Critically Endangered | Stable | 1158

When considering how to change the model, you should think about the outcome of the score on your decisions. For instance, will weighting a "Critically Endangered" species higher on the scale result in the inclusion or exclusion of more rare species? Will the way you aggregate spatial data to summarize extinction risk for your area take into account the influence of species with smaller ranges size, or will that information be lost in the averaging process? An inherent disadvantage for conservation may occur when rare species get rarer in the future, and will therefore have a relatively small influence on the score while common species drive the results.

You should also think about the reference point for scores that signal poor **Biodiversity** status. You can use the same threshold as the Global Assessments which say that places with extinction risk scores greater than seventy-five percent will get scores of zero. This is an estimation based on the literature of mass extinctions (e.g., Barnosky *et al*., 2011) and could be applied across scales. You don’t need all species extinct for there to be a zero, so you will have to choose how to rescale it, and whether the risk effects are linear or nonlinear. <!---(See Section, **Data Transformations**)--->

### Practical Considerations for Special Places

#### Ready to start on the **Lasting Special Places** sub-goal of the **Special Places** Goal?

*Ideal Approach*

Ideally, you would be able to produce a list of all the places that people within your region consider special, and then assess how well they are protected. How well they are protected could be the percentage of area protected, and you could also find how well they are protected using other data. This sub-goal could also be based on the extent to which people partaking in spiritual or religious activities are able to access special places.

*Practical Guidance*

It is important to think about how this goal can be tailored to your region. This sub-goal is intended to be meaningful and specific to your location. Keep in mind, however, that it is a difficult goal to express accurately, since it attempts to capture how people interact culturally with their coastal places.

> In the U.S. West Coast assessment (2014), **Special Places** was one of the most important goals. At the end of the day, how people interact with ‘their ocean’ is fundamentally important to whether they think oceans are healthy or not.

The main consideration for this sub-goal is the spatial data and the list of protected areas. Typically in assessments, the area of designated protected places relative to a target of thirty percent coastal area protected is used as a measure. Coastal area could be based off a 1 km^2 buffer, as in the Global Assessment, or it could be based on what is reasonable to your area; in any case, you would want to consider how far out from shore you should include as well; would it be 3 nautical miles, or as far as your territorial waters up to 12 nautical miles?

> In the Brazil Assessment (2014), the **Lasting Special Places** sub-goal was assessed using a national database of protected areas that included fully-protected and sustainable use designations at federal, state and municipal levels, and included indigenous lands. The highest-scoring area contained the largest continuous extent of protected areas within the country in what is called the Biodiversity Corridor of Amapa´.

Data sources should be specific to your region. International databases, like the World Database of Protected Areas, offer rich information, but they may not be as up-to-date as the list of national parks in your area, and may not have as much information on the quality of protection. If you have more information on quality, you could think about another approach than the thirty percent reference point target.

*Thinking Ahead*

You should be thinking about **Resilience** at the same time as you think about **Lasting Special Places** sub-goal of **Special Places**. This is because the **LSP** sub-goal makes use of protected areas, and some of the same information gathered on projected areas can be used to create resilience data layers like Marine Protected Areas (See section, **Pressures and Resilience**).

Once you area ready, you should return to the **Iconic Species** sub-goal of **Lasting Special Places** and think about how to combine the two together. Do you want to use equal or unequal weighting? How do the two components relate to each other?

> In the Global Assessment framework, the **Special Places** sub-goals were weighted equally and combined in an average to create a single goal score. The two sub-goals are averaged currently in the framework. But these could be combined with a weighted average, or even a different sub-goal instead of Sense of Place.

#### History of the Approach

Assessment | Model Description and Reference Point | Evolution of Approach | Interpreting a score
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
**Global 2012** | The status of this sub-goal is calculated by combining the percent of coastal waters that are coastal marine protected areas and the percent of coastline that is protected. Both sea and land components are compared to a target (reference point) of 30% protection.<br  /><br  />Using lists of protected areas as the catalogue of special places then creates the problem of determining a reference condition. We do not know how many special places have yet to be protected, and so we end up having all identified special places also being protected. To solve this problem we make two important assumptions. First, we assume that all regions have roughly the same percentage of their coastal waters and coastline that could qualify as lasting special places. In other words, they all have the same reference target (as a percentage of the total area). Second, we assume that protecting 30% of the coastal area is a target that allows protecting enough lasting special places to achieve the goal. | This sub-goal is particularly hard to quantify, because there are no lists of marine places protected especially for their cultural, spiritual, aesthetic or related intangible values.  Ideally one would survey every community around the world to determine the top list of such special places, and then assess how those locations are faring relative to a desired state (e.g., protected or well managed), but in the absence of such lists we assume areas that are protected for other reasons (e.g. MPAs, reserves, historical areas, World Heritage sites, etc.) represent these special places (i.e. the effort to protect them suggests they are important places) and that in each region there are enough special places to cover at least 30% of the coastal strip. Clearly this is an imperfect assumption, but in many cases it was true so that it did not prove unrealistic. | A score of 100 would indicate that 30% of the waters and land immediately adjacent to the coast is protected.
**Global 2013** | The model and reference point were the same as Global 2012. | The approach was same as Global 2012 |
**Brazil (2014)** | The model and reference point were the same as Global 2012. | The approach was same as Global 2012 |
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | The model and reference point were the same as Global 2012. | This approach also focuses on the protection status of all marine and coastal areas as was done in the global assessment, under the assumption that efforts to protect places suggest that they are significant to people. We recognize that for some individuals, placing regulations on an area to protect it may prevent them from the very activities that made those places special to them in the first place, such that higher protection may not represent a healthier state in their view. However, we use this approach here because data exist to calculate it and because, although imperfect, it does convey some information about lasting special places. If a place is special and appropriate regulations/protection are placed on that location (for example, limited access, restrictions or limits on uses such as fishing, etc.), we feel that this ensures long-term sustainability of a place people care about. |

#### Practical Considerations for Natural Products

> The **Natural Products** goal describes how sustainably people harvest non-food products from the sea.

#### *Ideal Approach*

Ideally, quantity, value, and a sustainability rating of the harvest method would be available for every marine and coastally-derived natural product within the regions of a study area. This could include a wide range of products depending on what is harvested in the study area, including corals, shells, seaweeds, aquarium fish, mangrove wood, or any non-food marine product that is harvested within a region. The ideal reference point would be derived from a functional relationship of the sustainability of the harvest for each product relative to the amount of product available in the ecosystem, informed by scientific studies. Without such information, assumptions and expert judgment will need to be made to set the reference point.

#### Ready to start on **Natural Products**?

Whether you use the approach from the global assessment or are developing your own new model entirely, there are a few tasks that will remain the same because are key to the philosophy of this goal.

The first is to identify **identify which products are in your study area.** For example, does your study area have corals, ornamental fishes, sponges? Does your area yield medicines from the sea, or other products that are not used for nutrition under **Food Provision**? Does your area harvest drinking water from the ocean through desalination plants? Is there a kelp or seaweed industry in your area? If there are multiple uses of the product, you must also consider what proportion of the product is used for food, and what proportion is used for other purposes. As another example, oil from marine mammals was considered but excluded from the global models, but if a region has a considerable amount of mammal oil harvest, they should include it in the calculation, keeping in mind that the sustainability of this type of harvest is likely to be low and should be reflected in the score.

The second task is to think about **where these products are harvested and how much of them are harvested** in these areas through a period of time. You should find spatial representation of these products, which can be done by knowing where they are derived from. Do they come from certain habitats (in the case of coral) or animals (in the case of fish oil)? This information will help calculate the sustainability of the harvest of eah natural product.  harvest amounts and the spatial data are used to calculate **exposure** further on, and can also be used to set the **relative weighting** between the products. These spatial data may have already been used in other goals, or they may lead you to find useful data that can be used in other parts of the assessment (See **Best Approaches**).

The second task is to think about **where these products are harvested and how much of them are harvested** in these areas through a period of time. You will have to assign geographic representation of these products, which can be done by knowing where they are derived from, ideally, or by assigning relative weightings. Do they come from certain habitats (in the case of coral) or animals (in the case of fish oil)? This information will help calculate the sustainability of the harvest of eah natural product.  harvest amounts and the spatial data are used to calculate **exposure** further on, and can also be used to set the **relative weighting** between the products. These spatial data may have already been used in other goals, or they may lead you to find useful data that can be used in other parts of the assessment (See **Best Approaches**).

The third component is to try to find the **sustainability** coefficients of the identified products. It is possible to measure sustainability in a number of different ways. Quantitative information can be used, or expert judgment, perhaps based on information or rough estimates of how sustainable the harvest method is, which is what was done in Global 2012. We based the sustainability component on the historical maximum harvest recorded, the maximum harvesting density recorded, and risk status assessments by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).  In the absence of these, we borrowed general principles from fisheries models to provide rough estimates. If these are given values you could simplify the model, or they could be derived from two factors, **exposure and risk**. The **exposure** will come from the spatio-temporal harvest amount data already prepared, and the **risk** will come from the scientific literature or a developed indicator. For both of those cases, the values can be calculated in separate equations as part of your data preparation process.

![Natural Products goal model from OHI Global Assessment 2013](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1JFU166u9J8-bYDxeEJPKoZjHOnUtOsz4GlsxlMgKsQo/pub?w=594&h=100)

> Global assessments borrow principles from fisheries science to make estimates of product sustainability. In the Global 2013 assessment the sustainability component was derived from the historical maximum harvest recorded, the maximum harvesting density recorded, and risk status assessments by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).

One very important thing to consider at this point is your **reference point for the relative harvest amount**. The relative harvest of your data is multiplied by the sustainability coefficient in the last step. Setting the reference point is a decision your team must make based on the available data and an inferred functional relationship between the harvest of the product and the amount in the system. Understanding the patterns in harvest can help inform how to set the reference point. For example, knowing whether harvesting effort was constant or whether product yields changed due to the market demand and not the availability. This information could help inform whether it is more appropriate to set the reference point as the peak yield of the time-series, or some percentage above or below, or some other approach that is both ambitious and realistic (**SMART** principles). The decision you make for the reference point should be based on the trend of the data; for instance, if your harvests have only increased over time, which may be indicative of an emerging economy, you will have to account for that.

I think having a graph of harvest yields as a time series, by product, would be a helpful visual.-->

Example: The Global assessment used the following information in the Natural Products equations:

product | relative tonnes (1) | weighting (2) | Exposure (3) | Risk (4)
----------|---------------------|-------------|--------------|------
coral | FAO |  FAO | coral habitat | all 1
sponges | FAO | FAO | coral + rocky reef habitat | all 0
ornamentals | FAO | FAO | coral + rocky reef habitat | 1 if blast/cyanide fishing, otherwise 0
fish oil | FAO | FAO | fish score/100 | --
shells | FAO | FAO | coral + rocky reef habitat | all 0
seaweeds | FAO | FAO | rocky reef habitat | --

#### History of the Approach

Assessment | Model Description and Reference Point | Evolution of Approach | Interpreting a score
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
**Global 2012** | For the status of each product, we assessed the most recent harvest (in metric tons) per region relative to a fraction of the maximum value (in 2008 USD) ever achieved in that region. This was under the assumption that the maximum achieved at any point in time was likely the maximum possible, and that the sustainable maximum harvest was lower than that value, similarly to what is known about maximum fisheries harvests (Srinivasan et al., 2008). The status for each natural product category is calculated separately and then combined by weighting each category by the proportional value of that product relative to the total value of all products. Part of the status calculation for each product category is a measure of sustainability; the goal captures exposure, risk, and viability of harvesting the product.<br  /><br  />The reference point for Natural Products was based on the fisheries concept of maximum sustainable yield (MSY), applied to the extraction of natural products. MSY was assessed for each type of product quantified globally, and a temporal (historic benchmark) reference point for each product was defined as 35% below the maximum harvest that had been produced to date in the region being evaluated. The 35% buffer protects against the possibility that the maximum historical harvest was not sustainable. A high score indicates that a region’s current sustainable rate of harvest is near to and not more than 65% of the historic maximum possible sustainable harvest achieved in that region. | Natural products data were available for coral, ornamental fish, fish oil, seaweeds and marine plants, shells, and sponges from the UN FAO. Using these data, we weighted each category by the sustainability of harvest. We did not have data for other key natural products such as wood from mangroves, and we excluded oils from mammals as they are widely seen as (currently) unsustainably harvested due to low mammal populations. Mammal oils represented a small (~<2%) and decreasing amount of total oil harvest each year (since 1993 it has been well below 1%), although for some regions it remains a significant percent of total oil harvested. | A score of 100 would indicate that a region’s natural product yield equals 65% of its historic maximum. A low score indicates that a region has the potential to improve sustainable harvests of natural products, either by eliminating overharvesting, increasing harvests that are too low, or reducing the pressures that decrease potential harvests. The more natural products extracted sustainably, the higher the score, provided that the harvest does not exceed the 65% precautionary level.
**Global 2013** | The goal model and reference point had the same approach as Global 2012, although the data processing did change | We used the same data and basic approach as for Global 2012, but developed several methods to fill gaps in data that resulted from inconsistencies in the data reported to FAO. In particular, many regions only report either data on harvest or on the monetary value of each product for a given year, but not both. Since the score is computed as a weighted sum of individual product scores, if either the weight or the product score was 0, these mismatches in reporting would cause products to ‘drop out’ of the calculation of overall status, thus losing real data.  The gap filling methods we developed estimated the US dollar value of harvested products from the tonnage reported; or the tonnage harvested based on a product’s reported economic value. |
**Brazil (2014)** | The goal models and reference points used the same approach as Global 2012 | This used the same data and approach as for Global 2012. |
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | Not included in this assessment. Scores were not calculated because there are few data available on local-scale harvest and this is currently no longer pursued in any measurable quantities, and in the past had occurred mostly in the southern California region. Given this situation, the two options for how to include this goal in the assessment were to give the southern California region a zero (lowering the overall Index score), or to have the goal drop out completely of the assessment. The former option would assume there was demand for seaweed that was no longer met because the resource had been depleted, the latter assumes there is not enough demand for seaweed to make it commercially viable and so it is no longer harvested. We felt the latter was a more likely scenario. | Because this goal was not included, this assessment  had 9 goals that all had equal weighting. |

### Practical Considerations for Economic Goals and Tourism

> The **Coastal Livelihoods and Economies** goal rewards productive coastal economies that avoid the loss of ocean-dependent livelihoods while maximizing livelihood quality. The **Tourism and Recreation** goal captures the value people have for experiencing and taking pleasure in coastal areas.

Some goals in your assessment will draw from economic information. Such goals that you can approach together include the **Livelihoods and Economies** and **Tourism and Recreation** goals. If you have sub-goals for these, you will have to decide how to weight them in the goal score. If you find jobs, wages, and revenue data broadly, you will have to decide how to apportion it appopriately between **Livelihoods and Economies** and **Tourism and Recreation** given their different philosophies.

In your regional assessment, there is the opportunity to study the behavior of economic trends in your area. You can examine time-series with greater detail and, for example, establish a different time-periods that reflect economic cycles in your area, or even process the data to eliminate the “noise” from fluctuations and capture more persistent trends. You also have the chance to factor in the sustainability of the jobs--something that has not yet been done in the Global Approach.

> TIP: **You will most likely simplify the given Global models.** This is because you will be looking at local economic scales, you likely will not need to adjust for currency differences, for example, as was done in the Global Assessment through such metrics as the Consumer Price Index and Purchasing Power Parity.

In your regional assessment, there is the opportunity to study the behavior of economic trends in your area. You can examine time-series with greater detail and, for example, establish a different time-periods that reflect economic cycles in your area, or even process the data to eliminate the “noise” from fluctuations and capture more persistent trends.

#### Ready to start on **Livelihoods?**

> The **Livelihoods** sub-goal describes livelihood quantity and quality.

Ideally, this sub-goal would speak to the quality and quantity of marine jobs in an area. It would encompass all the marine sectors that supply jobs and wages to coastal communities, incorporating information on the sustainability of different sectors while also telling about the working conditions and job satisfaction. The jobs and revenue produced from marine-related industries directly benefit those who are employed, and also those who gain indirect value from related economic and social impacts of a stable coastal economy, such as community identity and tax revenue. You should capture the indirect as well as direct benefits from jobs, wages and revenue from coastal communities.

*Practical Guidance*

The first step of this goal is to **identify the marine-related sectors in your area**. There are jobs that are directly connected to the marine environment, such as shipping, fishing, longshore workers, but also some that are connected indirectly, such as supplies and supporting industries.

> For example, the sectors for which data were found in the Global Assessment included tourism, commercial fishing, marine mammal watching, aquarium fishing, water and tidal energy jobs, mariculture, transportation and shipping, ports and harbors, ship and boatbuilding. Much of the data on wages came from the International Labour Organization.

After you have identified which jobs are in your area, you will want to find some **measure of their direct and indirect benefits**.There are two broad kinds of data you should be looking for. The first are direct data that feed into the model equations. These are jobs and wages data for the direct benefits of jobs. This includes the number of jobs in each area, and the wages or income for such jobs. You could find such information from you local national statistical office, or economics bureau, for example. The second are data that show the indirect benefits of these jobs to the local communities. This can be found directly or  indirectly through the use of economic multipliers. With multipliers you can attempt to estimate the revenue generated by jobs more broadly associated with marine sectors. It's encouraged to use economic multipliers from the literature.

> You can multiply the number of fishermen by an economic multiplier to estimate larger economic effects. This is because the fishing industry provides indirect jobs beyond just the jobs of the fishermen, ranging from gear manufacturing companies to restaurants and movie theaters where the fishermen spend their income.

Next you must think about how to use the data to **infer quality and quantity of jobs**. Do you have the old format of data going back in time? If so, can you check to see how wages per sector have changed over time? If all of the sectors change in the same way, for instance, they might show broader economic trends that you could use to project forward per sector per country to find a likely future state and infer relationships between them.

#### Ready to Start on **Economies**?

*Ideal Approach*

> The **Economies** sub-goal captures the economic value associated with marine industries using revenue from marine sectors.

Ideally, economic data would be collected coastally, and traced from sectors both directly and indirectly related to marine industries. When these data are not available it is possible to use revenue data at a larger scale and adapt them to a coastal area based on population distribution. The reference point in this sub-goal will likely be set as a moving window temporal approach.

*Practical Guidance*

You should be searching for these data at the same time as the **Livelihoods** sub-goal, because of the similarities of the data sources. You need to mainly find revenue data for the marine sectors in your area, after you have already identified the sectors.

*Reference Points for the Economic Goals*

| L&E component | Type of Reference | Point Example
|-----|-----|-----|
| Number of jobs | Temporal | Current number of jobs minus number of jobs five years before |
| Wages | Spatial | Highest observed value across reporting units |
| Revenue | Temporal| Current revenue compared to past revenue |

Because there are no absolute reference points for these goals, you will have to make the reference points relative to the given information. If you are following the Global approach, the reference points in **Livelihoods** sub-goal should be set as temporal approach comparing current to past conditions; they could also be done a spatial comparison to compare regions to the highest observed incomes in your area. In the **Economies** sub-goal, revenue has a moving target temporal comparison; we highly recommend that this remains a temporal comparison so that a specific place is compared to its performance in the past and not to anywhere else.

It is highly recommended that you keep the reference point for jobs as a temporal comparison, and only using a spatial comparison for wages.  Comparing the number of jobs across different places, for instance, would require at the very least adjusting values by the size of the workforce in each location.

One way to do the temporal comparison is to have a moving-window approach by comparing the value in the current year to values in previous years. If using a temporal approach, you must consider how far back in time to go. The Global Assessments used a five-year moving-window because it is intended to capture short-term changes in the trajectory. But then you must consider, would five or ten years accurately represent economic trends, or would it be skewed by the effects of an economic downtown? If there is a not economic downturn, do you want to reward an increasing number of jobs, or reward maintaining the same number of jobs--in other words, not losing any jobs?

> Your choice may differ depending on the given economic growth rate of your country. Are there policy targets in place for growth? Or has growth leveled out, and you wish to maintain livelihood quantity overall?

Lastly you will have to *combine the sub-goals*. You can weight the two sub-goals unequally if, for example, the number of jobs was considered more important than the wages rendered.

#### History of the Approaches

***Livelihoods***

Assessment | Model Description and Reference Point | Evolution of Approach | Interpreting a score
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
**Global 2012** | This sub-goal is measured as the number of direct and indirect jobs across sectors within a region plus the average purchasing power parity (PPP)-adjusted wages within each sector. Jobs are summed across sectors and measured at current and reference time points. Wages are averaged across sectors within each region and the reference value is taken from the region with the highest average wages across all sectors.<br  /><br  />In the livelihoods sub-goal, jobs had a moving target temporal comparison and wages had a spatial comparison. The reference point for jobs (and for the economies sub-goal) is a moving baseline because there is no established target for number of jobs (and setting a specific target number of jobs would be completely arbitrary). In these cases it is important to compare the same place to itself in the past, and not to compare it to a different place. Therefore, the objective of the jobs component is actually no loss of jobs. In addition, we want to ensure that we are detecting changes that are specific to marine-related sectors. Jobs must keep pace with growth in employment rates or sustain losses no greater than national increases in unemployment rates. For wages we assumed the target value for average annual wages is the highest value observed across all reporting units. | We assumed that sector-specific job and revenue multipliers are static and globally consistent, but distinct for developed versus developing regions (when such information was available), because we do not have data to resolve temporal or regional differences. For all other sectors where the data sources only provided direct jobs or direct revenue, we used sector- and development status-specific multipliers derived from the literature to estimate total job or revenue impacts. We did not apply multiplier values to wages since the cascading effects of earned income are more contentious. To account for broader economic forces that may affect jobs independent of changes in ocean health (e.g., a global recession), we adjusted (as noted above) relative values for the number of jobs by changes in national employment rates.<br  /><br  />While job identity has social and cultural value, there are not adequate data to track individual workers and assess their job satisfaction on a global scale. Also because of data constraints, this goal does not provide more credit for sectors or economic activities that are more ecologically sustainable. | A score of 100 would indicate that the number of marine jobs had not reduced relative to that number five years previous, and that the wages in the area were the highest anywhere.
**Global 2013** | Based on Global 2012, with some simplifications: Since many of the values were not available in 2010, older wages data were divided by the inflation conversion factor for 2010 so that wage data across years would be comparable in 2010 US dollars. These data were also multiplied by the purchasing power parity-adjusted per capita GDP (PPPpcGDP). Jobs data were adjusted by dividing by total number of people employed for the corresponding year: (1 – percent unemployment) * total labor force. This factor ensures that any changes detected are strictly due to marine-related dynamics and not driven by national macroeconomic events across all sectors, marine and not. One of the adjustment terms previously used was considered redundant and removed: an additional factor had previously been used to modify the wages data, obtained from the International Labour Organization (ILO).<br  /><br  />The reference point was the same as Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2012 except for a few simplified multipliers. |
**Brazil (2014)** | The model and reference point were the same as Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2012. |
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | This goal follows the same model as in Global 2012, but using local data with a slightly different list of sectors. Data came from the National Ocean Economics Program (NOEP); sectors include: living resources, tourism and recreation, shipping and transport, marine related construction, and ship and boat building/repair. For each of these sub-components we use sector-specific multipliers derived from the NOEP data so that we assess both direct and indirect effects. We recognize that sectors and economic activity within a region can be influenced by activities outside the region (e.g., fish caught in Alaska could be brought to Washington for processing, or vice-versa), thus leading to an over or under estimate economic benefits derived from marine ecosystems within the study region. As with any ecosystem study, defining boundaries for the ecosystem is an artificial operation, and linkages with external elements necessarily exist but are challenging to account for.<br  /><br  />The reference point was the same as in Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2012. |

**Global 2012** | This sub-goal is captured as the total adjusted revenue generated directly and indirectly from each sector (measured in 2010 USD), at current and reference time points.<br  /><br  />In the economies sub-goal, revenue had a moving target temporal comparison. Because there is no absolute reference point for revenue, this sub-goal employs a moving baseline. We made a correction to revenue based on a region's GDP (“no loss and must keep pace with growth in GDP or can sustain losses comparable to national declines in GDP”). The current and reference years used for unemployment and GDP data were based on the average current year and average reference year across the sector data sources used for number of jobs and revenue, respectively. | We assumed that sector-specific job and revenue multipliers are static and globally consistent, but distinct for developed versus developing regions (when such information was available), because we do not have data to resolve temporal or regional differences. For all other sectors where the data sources only provided direct jobs or direct revenue, we used sector- and development status-specific multipliers derived from the literature to estimate total job or revenue impacts. We did not apply multiplier values to wages since the cascading effects of earned income are more contentious. | A score of 100 would indicate that revenue has not decreased compared to its value five years previous.
**Global 2013** | The model was same as Global 2012, with a few simplifications:  revenue data were adjusted by dividing by GDP per region (reported in 2013 USD; data from the World Bank).<br  /><br  />The reference point was the same as Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2012, although simplified where appropriate. |

#### Ready to start on **Tourism and Recreation**?

> This goal will necessarily draw from different data sources than the Global Assessment, and so it is encourage to look at what other OHI+ and regional assessments have done. This goal demonstrates the flexibility of the OHI+ approach, so you are encouraged to think creatively.

*Ideal Approach*

> The **Tourism and Recreation** goal captures the value people have for experiencing and taking pleasure in coastal areas.

Ideally, you would find information for how the ocean in your area is used and enjoyed by local residents and tourists alike, thereby capturing the full range of values and touristic and recreational activities. Models will vary because there are many ways to potentially measure the delivery of this goal. The type of reference point used will depend on the data available.

*Practical Guidance*

Your approach will be different than the Global Assessments. In fact, the **Tourism and Recreation** goal shows how flexible the OHI+ approach is to adapting models with improved data or approaches.  It could be approached economically, and combined in the data searching for the **Livelihoods and Economies** goal, or done in another manner. You can get creative with your approach, and you are encouraged to read the previous OHI regional studies, such as the U.S. West Coast Assessment (2014) and Brazil Assessment (2014), since examples are best studied for guidance here.

> For example, in the Brazil Assessment (2014), the density of hotel employees per state was used as a metric to determine how well touristed coastal areas were. This was better than using international travel information, as was used in the Global Assessment, because for a large country like Brazil, internal travel would not have been accounted for.

There are potentially dozens of variables that affect the number of people that engage in tourism and recreation within a region and where they go, including local and global economies, infrastructure to support the activities, promotion of particular locations, safety and security, political stability, and so on. If you can't find information on visitors, can you find information on access as a proxy for visitors? Do people have access to boating areas, or to surfing spots?

> TIP: If you already have access information for **Artisanal Opportunities**, that would not be double-counting here.

Because we currently do not know which variables matter and to what degree, or have data for many of these variables, we instead assume that tourists distribute themselves within a region proportional to where local populations are. This means that populated areas get a greater proportion of the tourists, so you can use population data to distribute other kinds of data you may find.

*Reference Points*

The reference point used will depend upon the types of data incorporated into the model. Does your country have growth rate targets? Do you want to increase tourism, or instead ensure it does not decline?

#### History of the Approach

Assessment | Model Description and Reference Point | Evolution of Approach | Interpreting a score
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
**Global 2012** | Data on international arrivals were used as a proxy for the value of tourism and recreation in each region, as this was the most comprehensive data available on a global scale. Additionally, the length of each tourist’s stay in a region was incorporated: we used tourist-days as the measure for this goal because some locations, especially remote ones, may receive fewer arrivals but tourists may stay for longer periods of time. We therefore multiplied the number of arrivals by the average length of stay in order to incorporate this information. Sustainability was incorporated by using the tourism competitiveness index (TTCI) from the World Economic Forum to capture the sustainability of the tourism industry. To account for different surface areas and number of inhabitants across regions, the tourist-day values were adjusted by local population size. <br  /><br  />Global 2012 used a spatial comparison reference point that compares each region to the best performing regions. | It is very difficult to have a quantitative measure of whether people are fully taking advantage of recreation opportunities offered by marine and coastal environments. We assumed that the amount of international arrivals (although this ignores domestic travel and recreation), however, could be informative of the desirability of a coastal location and that this must have some relation with the health of the system. We use a spatial comparison reference point that compares each region to the best performing regions. In order to compare different regions, we standardize by dividing the arrivals by the region’s population. <br  /><br  />Few non-economic indicators of tourism and recreation exist at the global scale, and thus the original approach in Global 2012 approximated this goal measuring the number of international tourists arriving by airline to coastal regions, accounting for their average length of stay, and adjusting by the region’s population size. This approach was sub-optimal because it did not account for domestic tourism, which is a large part of tourism in many regions. Also, since we only had information about total arrivals, not just those of people who were intending to spend time on the coast, we standardized by dividing by the total population, not just the coastal inhabitants, which tended to penalize especially large regions with large stretches of inhabited inland areas such as Canada, Australia and the USA.<br  /><br  />We log-transformed the status scores because of an extremely exponential distribution of scores driven by a few regions with much higher tourism rates relative to population size. Even after this transformation the distribution of scores remained strongly exponential and so we rescaled scores to the value of the 90th percentile region, which was 25% of the maximum score. The 17 regions above this score were all given status scores = 1.0. | A score of 100 in US West Coast would indicate that tourism in a specific place has not declined compared to its value in the reference year. In other assessments this would indicate that a value was not lower than the region with the highest score.
**Global 2013** | We calculated the proportion of direct employment in the tourism industry relative to total labor force. As in Global 2012, we used the tourism competitiveness index (TTCI) from the World Economic Forum to capture the socio-economic sustainability of the tourism industry.<br  /><br  />To determine the reference point, we identified the best scoring region across all years and rescaled all other regions across all years to that score (Bonaire; 2011, which was the most recent year of data). The high-scoring regions were outliers in the distribution of scores (the second best performing region scored 40 and the third scored 28); we therefore rescaled all scores to the 90th percentile score. All regions above this score received a status score of 100. | We created a new model different from Global 2012 by using employment in the tourism sector as a reasonable proxy measure for the total number of people engaged in coastal tourism and recreation activities. Employment within this sector should respond dynamically to the number of people participating in tourist activities, based on the assumption that the number of hotel employees, travel agents and employees of other affiliated professions will increase or decrease with changing tourism demand within different regions.<br  /><br  />Ideally there would be data available specifically for employment in coastal tourism industries, however the best data available at a global scale report total number of jobs, not just coastal jobs, within the travel and tourism industries. These data include jobs that are directly connected to the tourism and travel industry (i.e. for both leisure and business), including accommodation services, food and beverage services, retail trade, transportation services, and cultural, sports and recreational services, but exclude investment industries and suppliers. Unfortunately it was not possible to determine the proportion of jobs affiliated with strictly leisure travel. However, some (unknown) proportion of business travelers also enjoy the coast for leisure during their visit to coastal areas, such that we assumed all travel and tourism employment was related to tourism and recreation values. Additionally, it is true that not every tourist stays in a hotel and not everyone staying in a hotel is a tourist. Nevertheless, these data are of better quality and closer to what this goal is trying to capture than those used in Global 2012. |
**Brazil (2014)** | The model developed for Global 2012 was changed to use information on hotel employees for each coastal municipality in Brazil. Status was measured for each coastal state as the density of hotel jobs in coastal areas.<br  /><br  />We log-transformed coastal area under the assumption that density of hotel employees is not necessarily a measure of sustainable tourism, but that a balance likely exists between the density of tourists and the absolute number of tourists that a state receives (even if spread out over a larger area). Although the TTCI was included in the model as a measure of sustainability, this value is calculated at the national level, and was therefore applied equally to all states. Due to this, it has no effect on differences between regions within Brazil. The model could be improved if a state-specific index assessing sustainability of coastal tourism were available.<br  /><br  />The reference value used was the highest status value across all states over the time series, which was Rio de Janeiro in 2011. | The goal model for Brazil assumes that the majority of coastal hotels are located in proximity to the shoreline, and that the number of hotel employees is directly proportional to the volume of tourists an area receives. A report evaluating drivers of tourism in Brazil found a significant positive relationship between number of tourists and number of hotels; here we incorporate hotel employees which is likely a more sensitive metric, given that hotels can vary greatly in size and economic changes are likely to be reflected more quickly in number of jobs than number of hotel establishments. |
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | At this scale we were able to make use of detailed studies documenting the changes in participation in 19 different marine and coastal specific recreational activities over time. These data come from the National Survey on Recreation and the Environment (NSRE), which has been conducted 8 times nationally since 1960, with the most recent data available for coastal and marine specific activities from 2000. These observations were used to produce a predictive model that was employed to estimate participation rates in recent years, because the survey data were no longer being collected.<br  /><br  />This model employs a temporal reference point, comparing current status to the status in the year 2000. | For the tourism and recreation goal we developed an approach that took advantage of time series data on participation in a range of coastal and marine tourism and recreational activities. Participation rates more closely matched the intent of this goal and were a more robust proxy than international tourist arrivals data, i.e., the proxy used in Global 2012. We also changed the tourism and recreation reference point from spatial (used in the global analysis, where having values from >170 assessed regions made this reasonable) to temporal (given availability of time-series and limited scope for spatial comparisons). |
