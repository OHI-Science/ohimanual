##Sense of Place
##Practical Considerations

Sense of Place:
With this goal we tried to capture the aspects of coastal and marine systems that people value as part of their cultural identity and connectedness to the marine environment through experiences. This definition includes people living near the ocean and those who live far from it but still derive a sense of identity or value from knowing that particular places or species exist. We divided this goal into two sub-goals: Iconic Species and Lasting Special Places, and weighted them equally when combining them to create a single goal score.

###Recommendations for regional assessments:

Currently, the two sub-goals are averaged. But these could be combined with a weighted average, or even a different sub-goal instead of Sense of Place, perhaps one based on the extent to which spiritual or religious activities are able to access their special places.  It is important to think creatively about how this goal can be tailored more effectively to a specific region.
