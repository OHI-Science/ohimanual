#### regarding habitat health/condition:

<!---Via #362--->

Coral health is based on the % living cover on a reef. Ideally, historical data is available that can provide a reference point for % living cover. For our reference point, we used the mean predicted values for a country from 1985-1987. When this data was not available for a country, we used the value of neighboring countries. (There was also some analyses to control for the fact that the % live coral cover naturally varies over time, hence the use of "predicted values").

For soft-bottom habitat, we estimated status based on the intensity of trawl fishing as a proxy (pages 51 and 52 of SOM 2012).


habitat trend: Change in health/condition over time

Ideally, there will be enough years of data to directly calculate the recent change in health of the habitat (i.e., using a linear model to calculate trend). For example, for sea ice, we fit a linear model to a metric of sea ice cover for data from 2006-2011 (after some smoothing to account for natural variation).

This isn't always the case, and proxies or estimates might need to be used. For example, due to spotty salt marsh data we created trend categories of increasing (0.5), stable (0), and decreasing (-0.5) based on available data.
