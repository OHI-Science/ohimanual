## Discovering and Gathering Appropriate Data and Indicators

The OHI spans disciplines and integrates diverse data to give a comprehensive assessment of ocean health. A hallmark of the OHI is that it uses freely-available, existing data and indicators to create models that capture the philosophy of individual goals, and finding appropriate data requires good problem-solving abilities. There are many decisions to make when gathering from disparate sources, identifying good proxies and indicators, deciding reference points, and developing goal models.

** The accuracy of Index scores is a reflection of input data quality and the degree of understanding of the study area, and thus including the best quality and appropriate data and indicators available is of highest importance.**

Because the data and indicators you use will come from different sources and available from online databases, reports, spreadsheets and text files, they will also have different formatting. To include these data and indicators in your assessment, you will need to process these files into the format required by the Toolbox, which is explained in the section, **Formatting Data for the Toolbox**. When data have been prepared and formatted for the Toolbox, we call it a **data layer.** Because creating data layers can be quite time-intensive, data should only be prepared for the Toolbox after final decisions have been made to include the data or indicator in your assessment, and after the appropriate goal model and reference points have been finalized.  

There are many data layers included in the OHI framework. There are about eighty individual data layers from the global assessment that should be replaced with higher-resolution data in your study area where possible. You will need to search for data used to calculate status models as well as pressures and resilience layers.  

### Data sources

Existing data and indicators can be gathered from many sources across environmental, social, and economic disciplines, including:

* government reports and project websites
* peer-reviewed literature
* masters and PhD theses
* university websites
* non-profit organizations  

All data must be rescaled to specific reference points (targets) before being combined with the Toolbox; therefore setting these reference points at the appropriate scale is a fundamental component of any OHI assessment. This requires your assessment team to interpret the philosophy of each Index goal and sub-goal using the best available data and indicators. Some indicators already are scaled (e.g., from 0-1 or 0-10), and can easily be incorporated into your assessment since the reference points have already been identified.

### Gathering responsibilities

Gathering appropriate data requires searching for and accessing existing data. You do not have to go collect the data itself, but you do need to discover and acquire existing data. It is important that team members responsible for data discovery make thoughtful decisions about whether data are appropriate for the assessment, and that they get feedback from the full team to discuss the merits of different data sources. Data discovery and acquisition are typically an iterative process, as there are both practical and philosophical reasons for including or excluding data.  

When you begin exploring data possibilities, you can seek local data sources that could directly replace data from the global assessment provided in your repository. Such data would be better quality, i.e., higher accuracy and spatio-temporal resolution, than the data from the global assessment, and models may not need to change. However, we recommend first exploring other data possibilities that could capture specific characteristics to your study area. Assessments conducted at smaller scales are an opportunity to include characteristics specific to your study area that were not captured in the global assessment.

### The process of discovery

The most important thing to remember when gathering data and indicators is that they must contribute to measuring ocean health. Not all information that enhances our knowledge of marine processes directly convey information about ocean health and may not be appropriate within the OHI framework. Because of this, compiled indicators can sometimes be more suitable than raw data measuring single marine attributes.  

Begin by understanding and comparing the best approaches used in assessments that have been completed, including global assessments, Brazil, Fiji, and the US West Coast. For the smaller-scale assessments (i.e., anything but the global assessments), if finer-resolution local data were available in the study area, these data were either incorporated into modified goal models that used locally appropriate and informed approaches or into the existing global goal model. When local data were not available, the global-scale data and global goal models were used, which is least desirable because it does not provide more information than the global study. When looking for data, the following decision tree may be useful. This should be a goal-by-goal process:

### Requirements for data and indicators

There are six requirements to remember when investigating (or ‘scoping’) potential data and indicators. It is important that data satisfy as many of these requirements as possible, at times requiring gap-filling solutions. If requirements are not met and gap-filling solutions are not possible, you will likely need to exclude a dataset from the analyses. If data cannot be included, you may elect to use the global data layers or identify other data and a different modeling approach.

1. relevance to ocean health
2. accessibility
3. quality
4. how to set the reference point
5. spatial scale
6. temporal scale


#### Relevance to ocean health  

There must be a clear connection between the data and ocean health, and determining this will be closely linked to each goal model.

#### Accessibility

The two main points regarding accessibility are whether the source is open access and whether the data or indicators will be updated regularly.  

The Index was created in the spirit of transparency and open-access, using open-source software and online platforms such as GitHub, is to ensure as much accessibility and open collaboration as possible. Data and indicators included should also follow these guidelines, so that anyone wishing to understand more about the Index may be able to see what data were used and how. For this reason we emphasize the importance of using data that may be made freely downloadable, as well as the importance of clearly documenting all data sources and reasons for the choices made in selecting data, indicators, and models.  

Index scores can be recalculated annually as new data become available. This can establish a baseline of ocean health and serve as a monitoring mechanism to evaluate the effectiveness of actions and policies in improving the status of overall ocean health. This is good to keep in mind while looking for data: will it be available again in the future? It is also important to document the sources of all data so that it is both transparent where it came from and you will be able to find it in the future.

#### Quality

Understanding how the data or indicators were collected or created is important. Are they collected by a respected organization with quality control? Are there any protocol changes to be aware of, e.g., were there changes in the collection protocol to be aware of when interpreting temporal trends?



#### Reference point  

Most data will need to be scaled to a reference point, as you consider different data sources it is important to think about or identify what a reasonable reference point may be. Ask the following types of questions as you explore data possibilities:  

* Has past research identified potential targets for these data?
  + example: maximum sustainable yield in fisheries
* Have policy targets been set regarding these data?
  + example: maximum levels of pollutants before beach closures
* Would a historic reference point be an appropriate target?
  + example: percent of habitat coverage before coastal development
* Could a region within the study area be set as a spatial reference point?
  + example: a certain region a leader in creating protected areas


#### Appropriate spatial scale

Data must be available for every region within the study area.*

#### Appropriate temporal scale
  Data must be available for at least three to five years to calculate the trend. For some goals, where temporal reference points are desirable, longer time series are preferable.*  

\* It is not always possible to fully meet the spatial and temporal requirements with each source. In these cases, provided that the gaps are not extensive, it can still be possible to use these data if appropriate gap-filling techniques are used (See: 'Formatting Data for Toolbox' section).  

### Example: US West Coast data discovery

Below are examples of some decisions made when exploring available data for the US West Coast assessment. Determining whether certain data could be included began with a solid understanding of the data layers and models included in the global assessment. Since the US West Coast is a data-rich region, finer-resolution local data could be used in place of many of the global data layers. The US West Coast assessment had five regions: Washington, Oregon, Northern California, Central California, and Southern California.


#### Reasons data were excluded  

There are a lot of existing data that contribute to our scientific understanding of ocean processes and interactions but are not ideal for the OHI. Reasons to exclude data are both due to practical requirements (e.g., resolution, coverage, or other requirements that have been listed) and philosophical requirements (i.e., they do not help capture the attributes of interest for assessing ocean health). Some common reasons for excluding data are:  

* **The data do not cover the entire area of the reporting region**. The state of California had excellent, long-term data on public attendance at state parks that would have been quite useful in the calculation of the tourism and recreation goal. However, data were only available for three of the five regions (the three California regions but not Oregon and Washington), so they could not be used.  

* **There is not a clear and scientifically observed relationship between the data and ocean health**. Along the US West Coast, kelp beds are a very important habitat because of their contribution to biodiversity and coastal protection. However, kelp coverage variation and is driven primarily by abiotic natural forcing (wave/storm disturbance and temperature) and thus it is not a good indicator of kelp forest health, particularly in the case of anthropogenic impacts. For these reasons kelp coverage was not included in the assessment.  

* **The feature being measured may provide benefits to people, but this feature is not derived from marine or coastal ecosystems**. Sea walls and riprap provide coastal protection to many people along the US West Coast. However, these structures are not a benefit that is derived from the marine ecosystems, so only coastal habitats were included in the calculation of this goal. These data can be included as a pressure due to habitat loss. They were not used as a resilience measure because they can often have negative side effects (e.g., by altering sedimentation dynamics), and because they have limited long-term sustainability (i.e., they need maintenance).  

* **Data collection is biased and might misrepresent ocean health**. The US Endangered Species Act identifies a species list focused on species of concern within the US. As such, these data are biased in the context of ocean health since they only assess species whose populations may be in danger. For the calculation of the biodiversity goal, using these data would be inappropriate because this goal represents the status of all species in the region, not just those that are currently of conservation concern. Using these data may have shown the status of biodiversity to be lower than it really is because the selection of species to assess was already biased towards species of concern.

* **Time series data are not long enough to calculate a trend or a reference point** (when a historical reference point is most appropriate). For the US West Coast, the current extent of seagrass habitats was available, however, these do not exist for previous points in time in most areas, so could not be used to calculate the trend or set a historical reference point. Therefore, we estimated the trend in health of seagrass habitats using as a proxy the trend in the main stressor (i.e., turbidity). In other words, we assumed that the rate of seagrass loss was directly proportional to the rate of increase in turbidity. Similar solutions may be used to estimate trends in your own assessment, if there is scientific support for assuming that the trend of what we want to assess (or the relationship between the current state and the state in the reference year) has a strong relationship with the trend of the proxy data available.
