##Coastal Livelihoods and Economies
####Practical Considerations

**Lessons Learned (2014)**
<!---Taken from Conceptual Guide v2--->

The aim is to maintain (avoid the loss of) coastal and ocean-dependent livelihoods (i.e., jobs) and productive coastal economies (i.e., revenues), while also maximizing livelihood quality (relative wages). It does not attempt to capture any aspects of job identity (i.e. the reputation, desirability or other social or cultural perspectives associated with different jobs), although one can examine the component parts that make up this goal to evaluate individual sectors and infer implications for job identity.

###Recommendations for regional assessments:

There are several big decisions to consider when addressing the livelihoods and economies goal. The first is how to weight them when they are combined. In our assessments, the livelihoods and economies sub-goals are equally weighted when they are combined; it is possible to weight them differently.
Another important choice is the reference year that is compared with the current status of livelihoods and economies. We chose a 5-year window because it is intended to capture short-term changes in trajectory, but, in regional assessments, there is the opportunity to study the behavior of the time-series with greater detail and, for example, establish a different time-period that reflects observed cycles, or even process the data to eliminate the “noise” from temporary fluctuations and capture more persistent trends.
