### Discovering Data and Developing Models for Livelihoods and Economies

> The **Coastal Livelihoods and Economies** goal rewards productive coastal economies that avoid the loss of ocean-dependent livelihoods while maximizing livelihood quality.

Some goals in your assessment will draw from economic information. Such sub-goals that you can approach together include the **Livelihoods** and **Economies**. If you have sub-goals for this theme, you will have to decide how to weight them in the goal score. If you find jobs, wages, and revenue data broadly, you will have to decide how to apportion it appropriately between **Livelihoods** and **Economies**.

In your regional assessment, there is the opportunity to study the behavior of economic trends in your area. You can examine time-series with greater detail and, for example, establish a different time-periods that reflect economic cycles in your area, or even process the data to eliminate the “noise” from fluctuations and capture more persistent trends. You also have the chance to factor in the sustainability of the jobs if you have that information.

> **You will most likely simplify the given Global models.** This is because you will be looking at local economic scales, you likely will not need to adjust for currency differences, for example, as was done in the Global Assessment through such metrics as the Consumer Price Index and Purchasing Power Parity.

In your regional assessment, there is the opportunity to study the behavior of economic trends in your area. You can examine time-series with greater detail and, for example, establish a different time-periods that reflect economic cycles in your area, or even process the data to eliminate the “noise” from fluctuations and capture more persistent trends.

#### Where to start on **Livelihoods**?

> The **Livelihoods** sub-goal describes livelihood quantity and quality.

Ideally, this sub-goal would speak to the quality and quantity of marine jobs in an area. It would encompass all the marine sectors that supply jobs and wages to coastal communities, incorporating information on the sustainability of different sectors while also telling about the working conditions and job satisfaction. The jobs and revenue produced from marine-related industries directly benefit those who are employed, and also those who gain indirect value from related economic and social impacts of a stable coastal economy, such as community identity and tax revenue. You should capture the indirect as well as direct benefits from jobs, wages and revenue from coastal communities.

*Practical Guidance*

The first step of this goal is to **identify the marine-related sectors in your area**. There are jobs that are directly connected to the marine environment, such as shipping, fishing, longshore workers, but also some that are connected indirectly, such as suppliers and supporting industries. For example, the sectors for which data were found in the Global Assessment included tourism, commercial fishing, marine mammal watching, aquarium fishing, water and tidal energy jobs, mariculture, transportation and shipping, ports and harbors, ship and boatbuilding. Much of the data on wages came from the International Labour Organization.

After you have identified which jobs are in your area, you will want to find some **measure of their direct and indirect benefits**. There are two broad kinds of data you should be looking for. The first are direct data that feed into the model equations. These are jobs and wages data for the direct benefits of jobs. This includes the number of jobs in each area, and the wages or income for such jobs. You could find such information from you local national statistical office, or economics bureaus, for example. The second are data that show the indirect benefits of these jobs to the local communities. This can be found directly or  indirectly through the use of economic multipliers. With multipliers you can attempt to estimate the revenue generated by jobs more broadly associated with marine sectors. It's encouraged to use economic multipliers from the literature.

> You can multiply the number of fishermen by an economic multiplier to estimate larger economic effects. This is because the fishing industry provides indirect jobs beyond just the jobs of the fishermen, ranging from gear manufacturing companies to restaurants and movie theaters where the fishermen spend their income.

Next you must think about how to use the data to **infer quality and quantity of jobs**. Do you have data going back in time? If so, can you check to see how wages per sector have changed over time? If all of the sectors change in the same way, for instance, they might show broader economic trends.

#### Where to Start on **Economies**?

*Ideal Approach*

> The **Economies** sub-goal captures the economic value associated with marine industries using revenue from marine sectors.

Ideally, revenue data would be collected for all coastal regions, and traced from sectors both directly and indirectly related to marine industries. When these data are not available it is possible to use revenue data at a larger scale and adapt them to a coastal area based on the population distribution. The reference point in this sub-goal will likely be set as a moving-window temporal approach.

*Practical Guidance*

This goal can draw from a number of data sources. In your area there may be a national economics bureau or statistics office that has sector-specific revenue data.  You need to mainly find revenue data for the marine sectors in your area, after you have already identified the sectors. A number of sectors were not included in the Global Assessments because sufficient data did not exist. However, it might be desirable to include sectors such as ecotourism, sailing, kayaking, surfing, and offshore wind energy production, and scientific research, among others.

These goals also ones that might lead you to find resilience metrics. There are many economic indices and some might be appropriate for your area. For example, the Global Competitiveness Index was used in the Global Assessment as a resilience for this goal because it means that marine jobs are more likely to be maintained if an area gets a good score on the Competitiveness Index.

*Reference Points for the Economic Goals*

|L&E component | Type of Reference | Reference Point Example
|-----|-----|-----|
| Number of jobs | Temporal | Current number of jobs minus number of jobs five years before |
| Wages | Spatial | Highest observed value across reporting units |
| Revenue | Temporal| Current revenue compared to past revenue |

If you are following the Global approach, the reference points for the **Livelihoods** sub-goal should be set using temporal approach by comparing the current conditions to the past. They could also be done in a spatial comparison to compare regions to the highest observed incomes in your area. In the **Economies** sub-goal, revenue has a moving target temporal comparison; we highly recommend that this remains a temporal comparison so that a specific place is compared to its performance in the past and not to anywhere else.

It is highly recommended that you keep the reference point for jobs as a temporal comparison, and only use a spatial comparison for wages. Comparing the number of jobs across different places, for instance, would require at the very least adjusting values by the size of the workforce in each location.

One way to do the temporal comparison is to have a moving-window approach by comparing the value in the current year to values in previous years. If using a temporal approach, you must consider how far back in time to go. The Global Assessments used a five-year moving-window because it is intended to capture short-term changes in the trajectory. But then you must consider, if that amount of time would represent economic trends. If there is a not economic downturn, do you want to reward an increasing number of jobs, or reward maintaining the same number of jobs?

#### Examples of the Approaches

***Livelihoods***

Assessment | Developing the Model  | Setting the Reference Point | Other Considerations
---------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
**Global 2012** | This was measured as the number of direct and indirect jobs across sectors within a region plus the average purchasing power parity (PPP)-adjusted wages within each sector. Jobs were summed across sectors and wages were averages across sectors within each region. | The reference point for jobs was a temporal comparison using a moving-window value; the reference point for wages was the highest average annual wage observed across all reporting units. A score of 100 indicated that the number of marine jobs had not reduced relative to the number five years previously, and that the wages in the area were the highest anywhere. | The goal model assumed there was no-net-loss of jobs in order to account for broader economic trends. The economic multipliers were used for jobs and revenue but not wages.
**Global 2013** | The model was similar to Global 2012, with some simplifications. | The reference point was the same as Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2012 except for a few simplifications in multipliers, wage data, and jobs data. This was done because of data availability and in order to correct for national macroeconomic events across all sectors.
**Brazil (2014)** | The method was the same as Global 2012. | The reference point was the same as Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2012.
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | This goal follows the same model as in Global 2012, using local data for the sectors of living resources, tourism and recreation, shipping and transport, marine related construction, and ship and boat building or repair. Data and sector-specific multipliers came from the National Ocean Economics Program (NOEP). | The reference point was the same as in Global 2012. | This study followed the Global 2012 approach but used local data. It recognized that sectors and economic activity within a region can be influenced by activities outside the region.

***Economies***

Assessment | Developing the Model  | Setting the Reference Point | Other Considerations
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
**Global 2012** | The status used the total adjusted revenue generated directly and indirectly from each sector at current and reference time points. | In the economies sub-goal, revenue had a moving target temporal comparison. A score of 100 would indicate that revenue has not decreased compared to its value five years previous. The years used for GDP data were based on the average current year and average reference year across the sector data sources. | The study accounted for a region's GDP trend. The economic multipliers were used for jobs and revenue but not wages. The study assumed that sector-specific job and revenue multipliers were static and globally consistent, but distinct for developed versus developing regions.
**Global 2013** | The model was same as Global 2012, with a few simplifications;  revenue data were adjusted by dividing by GDP per region, reported in 2013 USD. | The reference point was the same as Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2012, with simplifications.
**Brazil (2014)** | The method was the same as Global 2012. | The reference point was the same as Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2012.
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | The method was the same as Global 2012. | The reference point was the same as Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2012.


### Discovering data and developing models for Tourism and Recreation
#### Where to start on **Tourism and Recreation**?

>The **Tourism and Recreation** goal captures the value people have for experiencing and taking pleasure in coastal areas.

This goal will necessarily draw from different data sources than the Global Assessment, and so it is encourage to look at what other OHI+ and regional assessments have done. This goal demonstrates the flexibility of the OHI+ approach, so you are encouraged to think creatively.

*Ideal Approach*

Ideally, you would find information for how the ocean in your area is used and enjoyed by local residents and tourists alike, thereby capturing the full range of values and touristic and recreational activities. Models will vary because there are many ways to potentially measure the delivery of this goal. The type of reference point used will depend on the data available.

*Practical Guidance*

Your approach will be different than the Global Assessments. The **Tourism and Recreation** goal shows how flexible the OHI+ approach is to adapting models with improved data or approaches. It is best to study examples for this goal, such as the U.S. West Coast Assessment (2014) and Brazil Assessment (2014). For example, in the Brazil Assessment the density of hotel employees per state was used as a metric to determine how well touristed coastal areas were. This was better than using international travel information, as was used in the Global Assessment, because for a large country like Brazil, internal travel would not have been accounted for.

There are potentially dozens of variables that affect the number of people that engage in tourism and recreation within a region and where they go. These include local and global economies, infrastructure to support the activities, promotion of particular locations, safety and security, and even political stability. If you can't find information on visitors, can you find information on access as a proxy for visitors? Do people have access to boating areas, or to surfing spots? Are the visitors there for both pleasure and business? For this goal you can use population data to distribute other kinds of data you may find.

*Reference Points*

The reference point used will depend upon the types of data incorporated into the model. Does your country have growth rate targets? Do you want to increase tourism, or instead ensure it does not decline?

#### Examples of the Approach

Assessment | Developing the Model  | Setting the Reference Point | Other Considerations
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
**Global 2012** | This goal measured the number of international tourists arriving by airline to coastal regions, accounting for their average length of stay, and adjusting by population size. The data were found through international airline arrivals and the Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI) from the World Economic Forum. | This study used a spatial comparison reference point that compares each region to the best performing regions. To compare regions, arrivals were divided by the region’s population. | There were data limitations that were comprehensive data available on a global scale. This approach did not account for domestic tourism.
**Global 2013** | The study used the direct employment in the tourism industry relative to total labor force and used the TTCI. | The reference point was the best scoring region across all years and rescaled all other regions across all years to that score. All regions above this score received a status score of 100. | A new model was developed using employment in the tourism sector as a proxy for the total number of people engaged in coastal tourism and recreation. It involved assumptions, but these data were of better quality and closer to what this goal is trying to capture than those used in Global 2012.
**Brazil (2014)** | The model developed for Global 2012 was changed to use information on hotel employees for each coastal municipality. The status was measured for each coastal state as the density of hotel jobs in coastal areas. | The reference value used was the highest status value across all states over the time series, which was Rio de Janeiro in 2011. | The goal model assumes that the majority of coastal hotels are located in proximity to the shoreline, and that the number of hotel employees is directly proportional to the volume of tourists an area receives.
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | There were data available for changes in participation in 19 different marine and coastal specific recreational activities over time. These observations were used to produce a predictive model that was employed to estimate participation rates in recent years. | The reference point was temporal, compared to 2000. | The approach took advantage of  time-series data. Participation rates more closely matched the intent of this goal and were a more robust proxy than international tourist arrivals data, and the reference point was spatial instead of temporal.
