### Practical Considerations

#### Recommendations for regional assessments:

The sub-goals were weighted equally when combined to create a single goal score.The two sub-goals are averaged currently in the framework. But these could be combined with a weighted average, or even a different sub-goal instead of Sense of Place, perhaps one based on the extent to which spiritual or religious activities are able to access their special places.  It is important to think creatively about how this goal can be tailored more effectively to a specific region.
