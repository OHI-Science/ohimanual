# The OHI Manual for Conducting an OHI+ Assessment

  >**Summary:**

> This guide provides an overview of conducting an OHI+ assessment to produce Index scores. An assessment requires discovering data and developing goal models before using the information with the software explained in this guide.

## Where you are in the process

> At this stage, you should have **Learned** and **Planned** for your assessment, and are now ready to **Conduct** it.

**Here you will learn how to conduct an Ocean Health Index+ (OHI+) assessment.** The OHI+ process consists of four  phases. In the first phase, you **learned** about the OHI to understand the philosophy behind the goals and the motivation for conducting a study. In the second phase, you actively **planned** to conduct your OHI+ Assessment. Now you will actively **conduct** the assessment by engaging with the work of finding the data, preparing the goal models, and taking the necessary steps to learn the software and produce the results. This is where the science of data discovery and goal model development comes in. In the following phase, you will **communicate** the findings and results of your assessment.

- >**Phase 1:** **Learn** about the OHI
- >**Phase 2:** **Plan** an OHI+ Assessment
- **Phase 3:** **Conduct** the OH+ Assessment
- >**Phase 4:** **Communicate** and Inform

## Why you are conducting an assessment

> Remember that the process of conducting an OHI+ assessment is as valuable as the results for policy and management uses.

**The Ocean Health Index (OHI)  framework** allows you to synthesize data and priorities at local scales. The OHI+ approach adds relevant data, indicators, and information into the overarching OHI framework. Because the methods of the framework are repeatable, transparent, quantitative, and goal-driven, the process of an assessment is valuable. Repeated assessments are valuable because they can be used to tack and monitor the progress of ocean health through time. First-time results are valuable because they establishes a monitoring baseline and call attention to the state of the data quality and availability in your area. Therefore preparing for the **Conduct** phase will require careful thought, consideration, and documentation, throughout this process.

## Where to Start When Conducting an Assessment
## How to use this guide

This manual provides information for:

1. Navigating the OHI+ WebApp to visualize data at global and regional scales
2. Modifying data and models within the Toolbox for an independent assessment
3. Guidance for frequently asked questions and troubleshooting

You can start by understanding the structure of the Global Assessments, other assessments, and the data that were involved. This will help you think about what should be done differently in your local context. You should also understand the nature of the WebApp and prepare for learning about using the Toolbox by identifying identifying local characteristics and priorities in your area and determining relevant goals to be assessed.

### Understand OHI Case Studies

**The Ocean Health Index (OHI)** project was created with a strong foundation in communication and collaboration. Following the initial publication by Halpern *et al*. 2012 in *Nature*, Global Assessments have been conducted annually (in 2013, 2014, and ongoing).  Smaller-scale assessments have been conducted as well, including for the U.S. West Coast (Halpern *et al.* 2014), Fiji (Selig *et al.* in press), and Brazil (Elfes *et al.* 2014).

You should be familiar with the approaches taken by these assessments. You can find these studies at http://ohi-science.org.  

> TIP: The OHI+ development team is prepared to provide guidance for assessments. However, you should first follow the steps in the supporting documentation of the past OHI assessments where possible.

### Understand WebApps and prepare for the Toolbox

The best way to do prepare for conducing your assessment is to **begin with understanding the WebApps.** As described in the section, "**Overview of the OHI WebApp**," most coastal countries have a WebApp that was created to facilitate planning and communication during your assessment. The WebApp presents data, goal models and calculated scores for each region (global administrative area identified by http://gadm.org) visually through maps, histograms, and tables. All data presented were extracted from the global analysis, and scores were calculated using global goal models. For a finer-scale assessment of ocean health in your region, these data files provided will need to be updated with available data and indicators for each region in your assessment. However, if better data are not available, you can use the data provided. Then, to dive deeper into data layers and goal models, you can explore your assessment's online repository, which stores all the information presented through the WebApp.  

We have also developed the **OHI Toolbox**  to enable groups to conduct independent assessments using the OHI framework and modifying it to their needs. The Toolbox is what links the data to the WebApps and produces the final output scores. The Toolbox enables the framework to be customized to an area of interest, incorporating goals, data, indicators, and priorities for defining and measuring ocean-derived benefits that are relevant to the chosen spatial scale. The information is then presented as output data as well as the WebApps, which can be used for orientation throughout the process, data visualization, and final reporting of your results to a broader audience.

### What to expect when conducting an assessment

> It is important for your OHI+ team doing the study to make the decisions and modifications that are most important for the region, and to clearly document what was done and why. At the same, your team should as creative and insightful as you can be.

There are **key considerations and process** that will be a part of every assessment. The process for conducting each assessment will be unique depending on the local context. For example, what data and indicators are available will determine how goal models can be tailored to the region, and what skill sets and resources are involved will affect the time it takes to complete the assessment.

#### Outcomes of conducting an assessment

Remember that **the process of conducting an OHI assessment is as valuable as the final results.** This is because while conducting an OHI assessment you will identify gaps in knowledge and data, produce decision-relevant information, and create an ocean alliance that combines knowledge and cultural values across disciplines. Conducting an OHI assessment requires engagement from as many different groups as possible, including research institutions, government agencies, policy groups, non-governmental organizations, and the civil and private sectors.  

**Finding the best data and indicators available is crucial for obtaining meaningful findings that can help inform decision-making.**  Assessments can incorporate higher-resolution data and indicators, local priorities and preferences, and develop tailored goal models and reference points, which produce scores that better reflect local realities. If a goal is not relevant in the local context, it can be excluded entirely. When you change goal models, though, it is important to capture the process in order to justify decisions that will inform the results. Similarly, pressures and resilience measures can be refined using local data and indicators. Index scores are only as good as the data on which they are based.

The Index scores can be **visualized to communicate the results** to collaborators and stakeholders. For example, the flower plot shown in the figure demonstrates a useful way to represent OHI scores. Goal or sub-goal scores are shown around the outside of the plot. The length of each 'petal'   represents the goal score, while the width of each petal represents the relative weighting of the goal or sub-goal. Sub-goals are weighted equally by default, as shown here, but can change depending on the regional context.

## Identify Local Characteristics and Priorities

You should identify the social and ecological characteristics and priorities that are the most relevant for your area. What are the key issues that must be included for your assessment to be credible, useful, and meaningful? What are the types of coastal habitats in your area? How do people generally relate to the ocean in your area? These are the kinds of questions you should consider prior to discovering data and gathering indicators to fulfill the goal models.

You should also identify regional characteristics. OHI assessments are the most relevant to policy and management decisions when they are conducted at smaller spatial scales. These spatial scales can include political subdivisions like countries, states, provinces, and eco-regions such as bays.

#### Identify Regions for Your Area

OHI assessments involve several **regions** within an overall **study area**. The goal scores are calculated for regions separately and then combined to produce an overall Index score per study area. Index scores are combined using an area-weighted average. For example, in the global assessment, there were 221 regions (nations and territories) within the study area (global coastal oceans). In your assessment, there will be regions that you find necessary and for which you have data.

## Determine Goals to be Assessed

You should think about which goals are applicable to your region once you have identified local priorities and context. Not all of the goals as presented in the Global Assessment may fit for you region. There are options when considering a change to a goal or developing a new goal model. You can either keep the model the same as given when presented with the software or you can change with expert guidance to better fit your needs. You can also remove a goal altogether or add a new one to the given list. You could also choose to weight goals differently as an alternative to adding new goals or removing goals in order to better answer the questions you are trying to ask.
