# The Ocean Health Index Assessment Manual

  >**Summary:**

> This guide provides an overview of conducting an OHI+ assessment to produce Ocean Health Index scores. An assessment requires discovering data and developing goal models before using the information with the OHI Toolbox software. This process is explained in this guide.

## Where you are in the process

> At this stage, you should have **Learned** and **Planned** for your assessment, and are now ready to **Conduct** it.

**Here you will learn how to conduct an independent Ocean Health Index+ (OHI+) assessment.** The OHI+ process consists of four  phases. In the first phase, you **learned** about the OHI to understand the philosophy behind the goals and the motivation for conducting a study. In the second phase, you actively **planned** to conduct your OHI+ assessment. Now you will actively **conduct** the assessment by engaging with the work of finding the data, preparing the goal models, and taking the necessary steps to learn the OHI Toolbox software and produce the results. This is where the science of data discovery and goal model development comes in. In the final phase, you will **communicate** the findings and results of your assessment.

- **Phase 1:** **Learn** about the OHI
- **Phase 2:** **Plan** an OHI+ assessment
- **Phase 3:** **Conduct** the OHI+ assessment
- **Phase 4:** **Communicate** and inform

## Why you are conducting an assessment

> Remember that the process of conducting an OHI+ assessment is as valuable as the results. Documenting decisions made, challenges, and successes can lead to a better understanding of the system and help guide future assessments.

**The Ocean Health Index (OHI) framework** allows you to synthesize data and priorities at local scales. The OHI+ approach incorporates data, indicators, and information relevant to the local context into the broader OHI framework. Because the methods of the framework are repeatable, transparent, quantitative, and goal-driven, the process of an assessment is as valuable as the final results. The first completed assessment for a study area is valuable because it establishes baselines and highlights the state of information quality and availability in an area. Subsequent assessments through time are valuable because they can be used to track and monitor changes in ocean health. With this in mind, the **Conduct** phase will require careful thought and consideration, and we encourage documentation and scripting within the OHI Toolbox to  facilitate transparency and reproducibility of future assessments.

OHI assessments should have a clear purpose and with that, explicitly identified spatial boundaries. Assessments can be relevant to policy and management when they are conducted at the spatial scales in which decisions are made. These spatial scales can include political subdivisions like countries, states, provinces, or ecological regions such as bays. The **regions** and the overall **study area** will be used throughout the data collecting and preparation phases, and will guide the output of the final results. In the OHI framework, goal scores are calculated for regions separately and then combined to produce an overall OHI score per study area. The number of regions varies with each assessment's study area: completed assessments have had 1-221 regions.

## What to expect when conducting an assessment

> It is important to make science-driven decisions and modifications that are most important for your study area, and to clearly document what was done and why. Your team should as creative and insightful as you can be.

There are **key processes and considerations** that will be a part of every assessment. Every assessment should build from the lessons learned of completed assessments and identify what local characteristics need to be included, prepare to use the Toolbox software, and continue to improve the methods of the assessment to calculate final results.

However, the time required to conduct an assessment will vary, depending on the size and composition of your team, the challenges of discovering and gathering information, and the scale of data processing and goal model modifications you will make with the information available. Team member skill sets and resources available will affect the time it takes to complete the assessment.

#### Understanding completed OHI assessments

It is important to **understand completed OHI assessments** before you begin tailoring the approach to your needs. By looking at specific uses of the OHI, you can identify how information is found and how it is presented, as well as what kinds of research questions are useful to ask. In many cases, studying completed OHI assessments will inform your approaches for discovering data and developing goal models later on in the process.

The OHI framework was developed with a strong foundation in communication and collaboration. Your assessment can leverage the collected knowledge and methods of the Global Assessment by Halpern *et al*. in *Nature* (2012) as well as the subsequent assessments conducted annually (in 2013, 2014, and ongoing). Each annual Global Assessment has improved goal models based on better data or better understanding of the system. Several smaller-scale assessments have been completed that are highly informative as well. The following have been published with supplemental online materials, and are available at http://ohi-science.org:

#### Identifying local characteristics and priorities

The initial actions of an assessment involve **identifying local characteristics and priorities**. This means considering all of the elements unique to your local context. What are the key issues that must be included for your assessment to be credible, useful, and meaningful? What are the types of coastal habitats in your area that should be included? How do people typically relate to the ocean in your area? These are the kinds of questions you should consider prior to discovering data and gathering indicators to fulfill the goal models.

The ability to find information should not be the only limiting factor. You should always try to keep in mind the social and ecological characteristics and priorities that are the most relevant for your area, even though data gaps and information limitations will influence your approach along the way. Knowing what you want to include will help drive your search for data and indicators, and what is available will ultimately determine how goal models can be developed for your study area.

#### Determining goals to be assessed

Once you have identified local characteristics important to your study area, consider whether all goals included in the Global Assessment are applicable to your assessment. Could new goals or sub-goals be added? Should a goal not relevant to your study area be removed completely? You may also decide to weight goals differently if you have local information about alternative weighting approaches. These decisions should happen as you begin your assessment and before you become more constrained with what kinds of information are actually available. At that point, you will likely modify existing goal models or develop a new ones based on the accessible information as you prepare to use the Toolbox software.

#### Discovering data and developing goal models

<!---Very drafty. Develop!
JSL: this part seems really good and I like that it's together as one here! Tiny thing: I would say 'data inputs' instead of 'data layers' yet since the 'layers' concept hasn't been introduced yet (that's later on for the Tbx)--->

The actual approach to conducting your assessment will depend on data availability and it will require iterations and creative thinking. It also requires problem-solving abilities. There are many decisions to make when gathering data. This is because your data will come from disparate sources, and you will have to engage experts to help identifying good proxies and indicators, deciding reference points, and developing goal models. OHI+ assessments should incorporate higher-resolution information, local priorities, and preferences wherever possible to develop tailored goal models and reference points that produce scores that best reflect local realities. Similarly, pressures and resilience measures can be refined using local data and indicators.

There are many data inputs included in the OHI framework. The process of discovering and gathering data and indicators is an important step that you will return to as you continue to conduct the assessment. The goal models you develop will also be an important process and it's important to document the decisions being made along the way. Keep in mind that both of these broad steps are part of the same overall process of conducing the methods of the assessment. It is an iterative process that will not necessary be linear, which is why your team should be prepared for all of the moving parts and the length of time required in conducting an assessment.


#### Using the Toolbox software

<!---Develop
JSL: I've done some restructuring but haven't developed fully
--->
Once you have identified all input information and redeveloped any goal models, your technical team can prepare to use the **OHI Toolbox software**. The Toolbox is used for organizing and processing information, documenting decisions made, calculating scores, and visualizing results. The Toolbox is open-source, meaning that it is freely available and able to be modified. You will access the software from online and will use several free software tools to conduct your assessment in a collaborative, transparent, and reproducible manner.

Accompanying the OHI Toolbox is the **OHI+ WebApp**, which is a visualization tool that displays input information and calculated scores in several ways, including an interactive map. Most coastal countries have a WebApp that was created to facilitate planning and communication during your assessment. The WebApp presents inputs, goal models and calculated scores for each region (subcountry administrative regions are identified by http://gadm.org) visually through maps, histograms, and tables. All inputs presented in a country's WebApps were extracted for each country from the global analysis, and scores were calculated using global goal models. 

The WebApp is a communication tool both within your team since not all team members may be involved with Toolbox calculations, and also beyond your team as you have results to share.

#### Outcomes of conducting an assessment

**The process of conducting an OHI assessment is as valuable as the final results.** This is because while conducting an OHI assessment you will bring together all ocean-based information together to the same place. In doing so, you will have a census of existing information and also will identify gaps in knowledge and data that in itself can help identify priorities for management or monitoring. With your team and advisors, you could also create an ocean alliance that combines both knowledge and cultural values across issue-areas and disciplines. Conducting an OHI+ assessment can engage many different groups, including research institutions, government agencies, policy groups, non-governmental organizations, and both the civil and private sectors.  

<!---I moved the paragraph about data to the data section above and deleted the para about interpreting scores because it didn't seem totally necessary here--->

Your completed assessment will have OHI scores for each region in your study area that can be compared with each other. These scores will not be quantitatively comparable with other OHI assessments, including global assessments, because they differ in the underlying inputs, goal models, and reference points. However, they can be *qualitatively* compared because the scores are an indication of how far a region is to acheiving its targets. <!---develop a bit more--->.  

OHI scores can be visualized using the WebApp. This is valuable for interpreting calculated scores and communicating results with collaborators and stakeholders. <!---continue developing and seam together/edit with the remaining part of this para---> The information output from running the calculations can be analyzed to answer research questions about the state of ocean health. Your team should already be thinking about the expected outcomes and what to do with the final results. This is where previous studies are a useful reference in understanding how to interpret goal scores, which will change according to the local context.

<!---add para here about repeated assessments being more useful than just one --->

<!---I moved this last para up to 'What to expect when conducting an assessment' --->


<!---  Tbx header and paragraph--moved above to the Tbx section
--->

<!--- I think we can cut this because it is redundant to the section above. But it's a good little paragraph so I was hesitant to cut it yet in case it would fit somewhere else, like in the WebApps page or something.

WebApps are powered by the **OHI Toolbox**, which organizes data inputs and calculates scores. The Toolbox enables groups to work independently using the OHI framework to capture local information and knowledge. The Toolbox is what links inputs to the WebApps and produces the final output scores. The Toolbox enables the framework to be customized to an area of interest, incorporating goals, information, and priorities for defining and measuring ocean-derived benefits that are relevant to the chosen spatial scale. The information is then presented as output data as well as the WebApps, which can be used for orientation throughout the process, data visualization, and final reporting of your results to a broader audience.

## How to use the OHI Manual to start your assessment

Conducting an assessment requires both an understanding of how past assessments have been completed and innovation to capture important characteristics of your study area using the information available. You can start by understanding the structure of completed assessments at global and smaller scales and the models that were created with the information available. Understanding the approaches in different contexts will help you think about what should be done similarly and differently in your local context. Identifying local characteristics and priorities in your study area will help you determine the relevant goals to be assessed.

Navigating through the WebApp can help frame your thinking and introduce you to the structure of inputs that will be required for the Toolbox software.

This Manual will guide you through the process with the following information:
