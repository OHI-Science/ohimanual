# The OHI Manual for Conducting an OHI+ Assessment

  >**Summary:**

> This guide provides an overview of conducting an OHI+ assessment to produce Index scores. An assessment requires discovering data and developing goal models before using the information with the OHI Toolbox software explained in this guide.

## Where you are in the process

> At this stage, you should have **Learned** and **Planned** for your assessment, and are now ready to **Conduct** it.

**Here you will learn how to conduct an Ocean Health Index+ (OHI+) assessment.** The OHI+ process consists of four  phases. In the first phase, you **learned** about the OHI to understand the philosophy behind the goals and the motivation for conducting a study. In the second phase, you actively **planned** to conduct your OHI+ Assessment. Now you will actively **conduct** the assessment by engaging with the work of finding the data, preparing the goal models, and taking the necessary steps to learn the OHI Toolbox software and produce the results. This is where the science of data discovery and goal model development comes in. In the final phase, you will **communicate** the findings and results of your assessment.

- **Phase 1:** **Learn** about the OHI
- **Phase 2:** **Plan** an OHI+ Assessment
- **Phase 3:** **Conduct** the OHI+ Assessment
- **Phase 4:** **Communicate** and Inform

## Why you are conducting an assessment

> Remember that the process of conducting an OHI+ assessment is as valuable as the results, and that documenting decisions made, challenges, and successes can lead to a better understanding of the system and help guide future assessments.

**The Ocean Health Index (OHI) framework** allows you to synthesize data and priorities at local scales. The OHI+ approach incorporates data, indicators, and information relevant to the local context into the standard OHI framework. Because the methods of the framework are repeatable, transparent, quantitative, and goal-driven, the process of an assessment is as valuable as the final results. The first completed assessment is valuable because it establishes baseline scores to interpret and identifies the state of information quality and availability in your study area. Subsequent assessments through time are also valuable because they can be used to track and monitor changes in ocean health. With this in mind, the **Conduct** phase will require careful thought and consideration, and we encourage documentation and scripting within the OHI Toolbox to  facilitate transparency and reproducibility of future assessments.

## How to use the OHI Manual to start your assessment

Conducting an assessment requires both an understanding of how past assessments have been completed and innovation to capture important characteristics of your study area using the information available. You can start by understanding the structure of completed assessments at global and smaller scales and the models that were created with the information available. Understanding the approaches in different contexts will help you think about what should be done similarly and differently in your local context. Identify local characteristics and priorities in your study area and determine relevant goals to be assessed.

Navigating through the WebApp can help frame your thinking and introduce you to the structure of inputs that will be required for the Toolbox software.

This Manual will guide you through the process with the following information:

### Understanding completed OHI assessments

**The Ocean Health Index (OHI)** was developed with a strong foundation in communication and collaboration.  Following the initial publication by Halpern *et al*. 2012 in *Nature*, Global Assessments have been conducted annually with improved approaches (in 2013, 2014, and ongoing), and several smaller-scale assessments have been completed. The following have been published with supplemental online materials, and are available at http://ohi-science.org:

> TIP: The OHI+ development team is prepared to provide guidance for assessments. Please be familiar with past approaches and documentation.

### Understanding WebApps and preparing for the Toolbox

The best way to prepare for conducting your assessment is to **begin with understanding the WebApps.** As described in the section, "**Overview of the OHI WebApp**," most coastal countries have a WebApp that was created to facilitate planning and communication during your assessment. The WebApp presents inputs, goal models and calculated scores for each region (subcountry administrative regions are identified by http://gadm.org) visually through maps, histograms, and tables. All inputs presented in a country's WebApps were extracted for each country from the global analysis, and scores were calculated using global goal models. For a finer-scale assessment of ocean health in your region, goal models may need to be adapted to incorporate available data and indicator inputs for each region in your study area. However, if better data are not available, you can use the inputs provided from the global assessment.

<!---I cut this last sentence because I think it gets a bit ahead of itself, maybe it could go somewhere later on:
Then, to dive deeper into data layers and goal models, you can explore your assessment's online repository, which stores all the information presented through the WebApp.  --->

WebApps are powered by the **OHI Toolbox**, which organizes data inputs and calculates scores. The Toolbox enables groups to work independently using the OHI framework to capture local information and knowledge. The Toolbox is what links inputs to the WebApps and produces the final output scores. The Toolbox enables the framework to be customized to an area of interest, incorporating goals, data, indicators, and priorities for defining and measuring ocean-derived benefits that are relevant to the chosen spatial scale. The information is then presented as output data as well as the WebApps, which can be used for orientation throughout the process, data visualization, and final reporting of your results to a broader audience.

### What to expect when conducting an assessment

> It is important for your OHI+ team doing the study to make science-driven decisions and modifications that are most important for the region, and to clearly document what was done and why. Your team should as creative and insightful as you can be.

There are **key processes and considerations** that will be a part of every assessment.
<!---I think this concept and the whole section should be developed further and be the main tone for the intro here. Let's focus on the key considerations and processes, and remove the flower plot and the study area/regions figure (unless that one does seem to be important in the end).

The process for conducting an assessment will also have elements unique to the local context. For example, which data and indicators are available will determine how goal models can be tailored to the study area, and what skill sets and resources are involved will affect the time it takes to complete the assessment.

#### Outcomes of conducting an assessment

Remember that **the process of conducting an OHI assessment is as valuable as the final results.** This is because while conducting an OHI assessment you will identify gaps in knowledge and data, produce decision-relevant information, and create an ocean alliance that combines knowledge and cultural values across disciplines. Conducting an OHI+ assessment requires engagement from as many different groups as possible, including research institutions, government agencies, policy groups, non-governmental organizations, and the civil and private sectors.  

**Finding the best data and indicators available is crucial for obtaining meaningful findings that can help inform decision-making.**  Assessments can incorporate higher-resolution data and indicators, local priorities and preferences to develop tailored goal models and reference points that produce scores that better reflect local realities. If a goal is not relevant in the local context, it can be excluded entirely. When you change goal models, though, it is important to capture the process in order to justify decisions that will inform the results. Similarly, pressures and resilience measures can be refined using local data and indicators. Index scores are only as good as the data on which they are based.

![Scores for Ecuador (ECU) as displayed in a flower chart on the the OHI WebApp. The length of a petal indicates the score for the goal or sub-goal, and the width of the petal indicates the goal or sub-goal weighting.](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1kj11Y0lYC0t2ofKD4fDkVUxopws7pIMpxtVD5JyDhAk/pub?w=960&h=720)

The Index scores can be **visualized to communicate the results** to collaborators and stakeholders. For example, the flower plot shown in the figure demonstrates a useful way to represent OHI scores. Goal or sub-goal scores are shown around the outside of the plot. The length of each 'petal'   represents the goal score, while the width of each petal represents the relative weighting of the goal or sub-goal. Sub-goals are weighted equally by default, as shown here, but can change depending on the regional context.

## Identify Local Characteristics and Priorities

You should identify the social and ecological characteristics and priorities that are the most relevant for your area. What are the key issues that must be included for your assessment to be credible, useful, and meaningful? What are the types of coastal habitats in your area? How do people generally relate to the ocean in your area? These are the kinds of questions you should consider prior to discovering data and gathering indicators to fulfill the goal models.

You should also identify regional characteristics. OHI assessments are the most relevant to policy and management decisions when they are conducted at smaller spatial scales. These spatial scales can include political subdivisions like countries, states, provinces, and eco-regions such as bays.

#### Identify Regions for Your Area

OHI assessments involve several **regions** within an overall **study area**. The goal scores are calculated for regions separately and then combined to produce an overall Index score per study area. Index scores are combined using an area-weighted average. For example, in the global assessment, there were 221 regions (nations and territories) within the study area (global coastal oceans). In your assessment, there will be regions that you find necessary and for which you have data.

## Determine Goals to be Assessed

You should think about which goals are applicable to your region once you have identified local priorities and context. Not all of the goals as presented in the Global Assessment may fit for you region. There are options when considering a change to a goal or developing a new goal model. You can either keep the model the same as given when presented with the software or you can change with expert guidance to better fit your needs. You can also remove a goal altogether or add a new one to the given list. You could also choose to weight goals differently as an alternative to adding new goals or removing goals in order to better answer the questions you are trying to ask.
