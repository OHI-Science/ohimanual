# The OHI Manual for Conducting an OHI+ Assessment

  >**Summary:**

> This guide provides an overview of conducting an OHI+ assessment to produce Index scores. An assessment requires discovering data and developing goal models before using the information with the OHI Toolbox software explained in this guide.

## Where you are in the process

> At this stage, you should have **Learned** and **Planned** for your assessment, and are now ready to **Conduct** it.

**Here you will learn how to conduct an Ocean Health Index+ (OHI+) assessment.** The OHI+ process consists of four  phases. In the first phase, you **learned** about the OHI to understand the philosophy behind the goals and the motivation for conducting a study. In the second phase, you actively **planned** to conduct your OHI+ assessment. Now you will actively **conduct** the assessment by engaging with the work of finding the data, preparing the goal models, and taking the necessary steps to learn the OHI Toolbox software and produce the results. This is where the science of data discovery and goal model development comes in. In the final phase, you will **communicate** the findings and results of your assessment.

- **Phase 1:** **Learn** about the OHI
- **Phase 2:** **Plan** an OHI+ Assessment
- **Phase 3:** **Conduct** the OHI+ Assessment
- **Phase 4:** **Communicate** and Inform

## Why you are conducting an assessment

> Remember that the process of conducting an OHI+ assessment is as valuable as the results. Documenting decisions made, challenges, and successes can lead to a better understanding of the system and help guide future assessments.

**The Ocean Health Index (OHI) framework** allows you to synthesize data and priorities at local scales. The OHI+ approach incorporates data, indicators, and information relevant to the local context into the broader OHI framework. Because the methods of the framework are repeatable, transparent, quantitative, and goal-driven, the process of an assessment is as valuable as the final results. The first completed assessment for a study area is valuable because it establishes baselines and highlights the state of information quality and availability in an area. Subsequent assessments through time are valuable because they can be used to track and monitor changes in ocean health. With this in mind, the **Conduct** phase will require careful thought and consideration, and we encourage documentation and scripting within the OHI Toolbox to  facilitate transparency and reproducibility of future assessments.

## What to expect when conducting an assessment

> It is important for your OHI+ team doing the study to make science-driven decisions and modifications that are most important for the region, and to clearly document what was done and why. Your team should as creative and insightful as you can be.

There are **key processes and considerations** that will be a part of every assessment. The include the steps of identifying what needs to be included in the assessment, taking the necessary steps to prepare to use the software to conduct the assessment, and continuing to improve the methods of the assessment in order to calculate the final results.
<!---I think this concept and the whole section should be developed further and be the main tone for the intro here. Let's focus on the key considerations and processes, and remove the flower plot and the study area/regions figure (unless that one does seem to be important in the end. OM: Agreed! Images removed, and moving this upward to the top.).

#### Understanding completed OHI assessments

It is useful to **understand completed OHI assessments** before you begin tailoring the approach to your needs. By looking at specific uses of the Index, you can identify how information is found and how it is presented, as well as what kinds of research questions that are useful to ask. In many cases, reading the completed OHI assessments will inform the approach taken to discovering data and developing goal models later on.

The original OHI was developed with a strong foundation in communication and collaboration. Your assessment can leverage the collected knowledge and methods of the Global Assessment by Halpern *et al*. in *Nature* (2012) as well as the subsequent assessments conducted annually (in 2013, 2014, and ongoing). The Global Assessments have involved changing and improving the goal models. Several smaller-scale assessments have been completed that are highly informative as well. The following have been published with supplemental online materials, and are available at http://ohi-science.org:

#### Identifying Local Characteristics and Priorities

The initial actions of an assessment involve **identifying local characteristics and priorities**. This means considering all of the elements unique to your local context. What are the key issues that must be included for your assessment to be credible, useful, and meaningful? What are the types of coastal habitats in your area that should be included? How do people typically relate to the ocean in your area? These are the kinds of questions you should consider prior to discovering data and gathering indicators to fulfill the goal models.

The ability to find information should not the only limiting factor. You should always try to keep in mind the social and ecological characteristics and priorities that are the most relevant for your area, even though data gaps and information limitations will influence your approach along the way. Knowing which data and indicators are available once you have begun finding them will help to more specifically determine how goal models can be applied to the study area.

The process of identifying local characteristics also involves identifying the boundaries for your assessment. OHI assessments are the relevant to policy and management decisions when they are conducted at smaller spatial scales. These spatial scales can include political subdivisions like countries, states, provinces, and ecological regions such as bays.T he **regions** and the overall **study area** will be used throughout the data collecting and preparation phases, and will guide the output of the final results. In the methods, goal scores are calculated for regions separately and then combined to produce an overall Index score per study area. Index scores are then combined using an area-weighted average. For example, in the Global Assessment, there were 221 nations and territories within the entire global ocean. The number of regions varies with each assessment's study area.

#### Determining goals to be assessed

You should think about which goals are applicable to your region once you have identified local characteristics. Not all of the goals presented in the Global Assessment may be a fit for your region. There are options when considering a change to a goal or developing a new goal model; you can either keep the model the same as given when presented with the software or you can change with expert guidance. You can also remove a goal altogether or choose to weight goals differently as an alternative to better answer the questions you are asking. This is a process that will happen when you start developing goal models and refining the data and indicators that go into them, as you prepare to use the software.

#### Discovering data and developing goal models

<!---Very drafty. Develop!--->

The actual approach to conducting your assessment will depend on data availability and it will require iterations and creative thinking. It also requires problem-solving abilities. There are many decisions to make when gathering data. This is because your data will come from disparate sources, and you will have to engage in many steps of expert judgment such as identifying good proxies and indicators, deciding reference points, and developing goal models.

There are many data layers included in the OHI framework. The process of discovering and gathering data and indicators is an important step that you will return to as you continue to conduct the assessment. The goal models you develop will also be an important process and it's important to document the decisions being made along the way. Keep in mind that both of these broad steps are part of the same overall process of conducing the methods of the assessment. It is an iterative process that will not necessary be linear, which is why your team should be prepared for all of the moving parts and the length of time required in conducting an assessment.

#### Learning about and using the software

<!---Develop--->
The turning point in conducting your assessment comes when you are ready to start learning about and using the OHI software. This software consists of the **OHI Toolbox** (**Toolbox)** and the affiliated programs that are needed to make it work correctly. This is where **having a technical team ready to engage with software** will be useful. It also consists of the **OHI+ WebApp** which can be used to guide the organization of information throughout the conducting process. Some of the software are used throughout the conducting process is easier to understand than the rest, and not all members of the team need to engage with all software programs. The software are used for different reasons that include calculating scores, visualizing results, and collaboration and storage of information to document the decisions being made in the process.

#### Outcomes of conducting an assessment

Remember that **the process of conducting an OHI assessment is as valuable as the final results.** This is because while conducting an OHI assessment you will identify gaps in knowledge and data, produce decision-relevant information, and create an ocean alliance that combines both knowledge and cultural values across issue-areas and disciplines. Conducting an OHI+ assessment requires engagement from different groups, including research institutions, government agencies, policy groups, non-governmental organizations, and both the civil and private sectors.

**Finding the best data and indicators available is crucial for obtaining meaningful findings that can help inform decision-making.**Assessments should incorporate higher-resolution information, local priorities, and preferences wherever possible in order to develop tailored goal models and reference points that produce scores that best reflect local realities. If a goal is not relevant in the local context, it can be excluded. When you change goal models, though, it is important to capture the process in order to justify decisions that will inform the results. Similarly, pressures and resilience measures can be refined using local data and indicators. Final Index scores can only be as good as the input data on which they are based.

At the end of the assessment, you will **produce scores that will require interpretation**. Index scores can be visualized to communicate the results in various ways in order share findings with collaborators and stakeholders. The information output from running the calculations can be analyzed to answer research questions about the state of ocean health. Your team should already be thinking about the expected outcomes and what to do with the final results. This is where previous studies are a useful reference in understanding how to interpret goal scores, which will change according to the local context.

The **amount of time required in conducting an assessment will vary**. This will depend on the composition of your team, the scale of your approach, and the ability and ease with which your team can discover and gather the right information needed to carry out an assessment. The local priorities should both guide the data discovery and goal model development. However, data availability will guide it as well. It will be useful to prepare for the contingencies of information gaps and the technical effort required to conduct the assessment to completion. The different types of skill sets and resources involved will affect the time it takes to complete the assessment.

#### Understanding WebApps and preparing for the Toolbox

The best way to prepare for conducting your assessment is to **begin with understanding the WebApps.** As described in the section, "**Overview of the OHI WebApp**," most coastal countries have a WebApp that was created to facilitate planning and communication during your assessment. The WebApp presents inputs, goal models and calculated scores for each region (subcountry administrative regions are identified by http://gadm.org) visually through maps, histograms, and tables. All inputs presented in a country's WebApps were extracted for each country from the global analysis, and scores were calculated using global goal models. For a finer-scale assessment of ocean health in your region, goal models may need to be adapted to incorporate available data and indicator inputs for each region in your study area. However, if better data are not available, you can use the inputs provided from the global assessment.

<!---I cut this last sentence because I think it gets a bit ahead of itself, maybe it could go somewhere later on:
Then, to dive deeper into data layers and goal models, you can explore your assessment's online repository, which stores all the information presented through the WebApp.  --->

WebApps are powered by the **OHI Toolbox**, which organizes data inputs and calculates scores. The Toolbox enables groups to work independently using the OHI framework to capture local information and knowledge. The Toolbox is what links inputs to the WebApps and produces the final output scores. The Toolbox enables the framework to be customized to an area of interest, incorporating goals, information, and priorities for defining and measuring ocean-derived benefits that are relevant to the chosen spatial scale. The information is then presented as output data as well as the WebApps, which can be used for orientation throughout the process, data visualization, and final reporting of your results to a broader audience.

## How to use the OHI Manual to start your assessment

Conducting an assessment requires both an understanding of how past assessments have been completed and innovation to capture important characteristics of your study area using the information available. You can start by understanding the structure of completed assessments at global and smaller scales and the models that were created with the information available. Understanding the approaches in different contexts will help you think about what should be done similarly and differently in your local context. Identifying local characteristics and priorities in your study area will help you determine the relevant goals to be assessed.

Navigating through the WebApp can help frame your thinking and introduce you to the structure of inputs that will be required for the Toolbox software.
