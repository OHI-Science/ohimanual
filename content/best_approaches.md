 ## Best approaches for goals, pressures and resilience

 ## Goals to approach together

- do HAB-based goals together (CS, CP, HAB)

This is because the data layer, `Hab_extent`, is used in multiple places in `Functions.R`, including:

* NP
* FIS
* CS
* CP

- do FIS and FIS pressure together
- do MAR and MAR pressure together
- also Baltic team's plan of action

 **History of the Approach (lessons learned 2014)**
 <!---Taken from Conceptual Guide v2--->

>Overall Model:
For each goal and sub-goal model and for each assessment, we will describe the models, evolution of the approach, reference point, how to interpret the score, and also recommendations for conducting regional assessments. When appropriate, we provide recommendations at both the goal and sub-goal levels.

###Where to start?

Any assessment will depend on the available data, which requires creative thinking, particularly when ideal data are unavailable. Determining the appropriate scale and defining the study area and any regions within the study area will also depend on available data. The scale and resolution of available data can help inform the scale of the study area to be analyzed and how to divide it into regions.
To consider as you get started:
Data included to calculate scores are partly based on the philosophical framework of the Ocean Health Index (see Part I), and partly based on data available. Several goals that combine across categories have many potential data sources that could be included (or excluded): in particular the natural products, livelihoods and economies, and habitat based goals. The existence of the data itself will drive a lot of these decisions, but here are some guidelines to help determine if data are appropriate philosophically:
* Do the data represent something truly ocean-based, and natural (i.e. not man-made)?
* How would the reference point be calculated?
* Do data cover the appropriate spatial scales?
* Do data cover the appropriate temporal scales?

###Which data are available?

Humans interact with and depend upon the oceans in complex ways, some of which are familiar and easy to measure, such as providing seafood, transporting goods, or disposing of waste. Other benefits are more difficult to measure, such as the way marine-related jobs indirectly affect coastal communities, how different habitats mediate storm damage or the benefits people receive or perceive simply from living near the ocean. Thinking creatively and exploring the data available can make the Index more representative of reality.

It is important to think creatively and beyond the interests of a specific institution or primary field of study. Google or other internet search engines are great starting places: investigate what kinds of information are available from government and public records, scientific literature, academic studies, surveys and reports or other sources.

Data used in the Ocean Health Index spans a wide array of disciplines, both within and outside of oceanography and marine ecology. Therefore, it is necessary to look beyond the most known or obvious data sources to find data relevant for the goals in the region. Discussions with colleagues, literature searches, emails to experts, and search engines are good ways to understand what kinds of data are collected and to hunt for appropriate data.

###What scale is appropriate?

Here it is important to think about why is there interest in completing an OHI assessment. If managers or policy makers are interested, at what scale do they work? Where are the political boundaries? These questions are important to keep the OHI assessment relevant, but ultimately data availability will be most important in how to define regional boundaries for the OHI.
