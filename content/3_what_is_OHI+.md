# What is OHI+?

> Your assessment is an example of independent assessment called Ocean Health Index+ (OHI+). At this stage of the process, you have **Learned** and **Planned** for the assessment, and are now ready to **Conduct** it.

The Ocean Health Index framework presents a highly tailorable approach ready to meet the needs and priorities of those who wish to use the ocean sustainably. Here you will learn how to conduct an Ocean Health Index+ (OHI+) assessment.  The OHI+ approach adds new inputs and information to the overarching OHI framework that consist of data and indicators that are relevant to the local context. Because method of the framework is repeatable, transparent, quantitative, and goal-driven, repeated assessments are invaluable because they can be used to tack and monitor the progress of ocean health through time. Even a first-effort OHI+ is valuable because it establishes a baseline against which to monitor change.

>Such a flexible framework allows OHI+ assessments to adapt to local conditions while still being useful for management.

The Index is the first assessment tool that provides a common platform for scientifically combining and comparing key elements from all dimensions of the oceans health — biological, physical, economic, and social – to measure how sustainably people are using the ocean. By allowing for a comprehensive and integrated view of marine systems as a way to understand the trade-offs and synergies among these goals, the Index represents a significant advance over conventional single-sector approaches to assessing sustainability as communicated through other kinds of index efforts. Because of this, preparing the conducting phase will require careful thought, consideration, and documentation, throughout this scientific process.

## The Process of OHI+: Phase Three

> TIP: The amount of time required to do an OHI+ Assessment will vary.

The OHI+ process consists of four distinct phases. In the first phase, you **learned** about the OHI and understood the philosophy behind it and the motivation for conducting your study. In the second phase, you actively **planned** to conduct an OHI+ Assessment. Now, in the third phase, you will **conduct** the assessment by engaging with the science of finding the data, preparing the goal models, and taking the necessary steps to learn the software and produce the results. In the final phase, you will communicate the results of your OHI+ Assessment in order to inform stakeholders who will use its findings.

- **Phase 1:** **Learn** about the OHI
- **Phase 2:** **Plan** an OHI+ Assessment
- **Phase 3:** **Conduct** the OH+ Assessment
- **Phase 4:** **Communicate** and Inform
