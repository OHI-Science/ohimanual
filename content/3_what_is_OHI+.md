# What is OHI+?

> Your assessment will be an example of independent Ocean Health Index+ assessment (OHI+). At this stage, you should have **Learned** and **Planned** for your assessment, and are now ready to **Conduct** it.

The Ocean Health Index framework presents a highly tailorable approach ready to meet the needs and priorities of those who wish to use the ocean sustainably. Here you will learn how to conduct an Ocean Health Index+ (OHI+) assessment.  The OHI+ approach adds relevant inputs and information to the overarching OHI framework and consists of data and indicators that are specific to the local context. Because the methods of the framework are repeatable, transparent, quantitative, and goal-driven, repeated assessments are valuable because they can be used to tack and monitor the progress of ocean health through time. Even if yours is a first effort, your OHI+ is valuable because it establishes a monitoring baseline and calls attention to the state of the data quality and availability in your area. Such a flexible approach allows OHI+ assessments to adapt to local conditions while still being useful for management.

> Remember that when conducting an assessment, the process is just as valuable as the results.

The Index is an assessment tool that provides a common platform for scientifically combining and comparing key elements from all dimensions of the oceans health — biological, physical, economic, and social – to measure how sustainably people are using the ocean. By allowing for a comprehensive and integrated view of marine systems as a way to understand the trade-offs and synergies among these goals, the Index represents a significant advance over conventional single-sector approaches to assessing sustainability as communicated through other kinds of index efforts. Because of this, preparing the conducting phase will require careful thought, consideration, and documentation, throughout this process.

### The Process of OHI+

The OHI+ process consists of four distinct phases. In the first phase, you **learned** about the OHI and understood the philosophy behind it and the motivation for conducting your study. In the second phase, you actively **planned** to conduct an OHI+ Assessment. Now, in the third phase, you will **conduct** the assessment by engaging with the science of finding the data, preparing the goal models, and taking the necessary steps to learn the software and produce the results. In the final phase, you will communicate the results of your OHI+ Assessment in order to inform stakeholders who will use its findings.

- >**Phase 1:** **Learn** about the OHI
- >**Phase 2:** **Plan** an OHI+ Assessment
- **Phase 3:** **Conduct** the OH+ Assessment
- >**Phase 4:** **Communicate** and Inform

#### What to expect when conducting an assessment
<!---From Conducting_assessment--->
There are key considerations and processes that will be a part of every assessment, however, the process for conducting each assessment will be unique depending on the local context. For example: what data and indicators are available will determine how goal models can be tailored to the region, and what skillsets and resources are involved will affect the time it takes to complete the assessment.

> In OHI+,it is important for your team doing the study to make the decisions and modifications that are most important for the region, and then defend it clearly what was done and why. At the same, your team should  as creative and insightful as you can be.

#### Where to start when conducting an assessment

You should start by understanding the structure of the global assessment and the data involved will help you think about what should be done differently in your local context.  

The best way to do this is to begin with the WebApps. As described in the section, "**Overview of the OHI WebApp**," most coastal countries have a WebApp that was created to facilitate planning and communication during your assessment. The WebApp presents data, goal models and calculated scores for each region (global administrative area identified by http://gadm.org) visually through maps, histograms, and tables. All data presented were extracted from the global analysis, and scores were calculated using global goal models. For a finer-scale assessment of ocean health in your region, these data files provided will need to be updated with available data and indicators for each region in your assessment. However, if better data are not available, you can use the data provided. Then, to dive deeper into data layers and goal models, you can explore your assessment's GitHub repository, which stores all the information presented through the WebApp.  

You should also be familiar with the approaches taken by other assessments adapted from the global context, including Brazil, the US West Coast, and Fiji. You can find these studies at http://ohi-science.org.  

While our team of scientists and managers is prepared to provide guidance for assessments, you should follow the steps in this training program to complete your assessment as autonomously as possible.

### Expected outcomes

**The process of conducting an OHI assessment is as valuable as the final results.** This is because while conducting an OHI assessment you will identify gaps in knowledge and data, produce decision-relevant information, and create an ocean alliance that combines knowledge and cultural values across disciplines. Conducting an OHI assessment requires engagement from as many different groups as possible, including research institutions, government agencies, policy groups, non-governmental organizations, and the civil and private sectors.  

**Finding the best data and indicators available is crucial for obtaining meaningful findings that can help inform decision-making.**  Assessments can incorporate higher-resolution data and indicators, local priorities and preferences, and develop tailored goal models and reference points, which produce scores that better reflect local realities. If a goal is not relevant in the local context, it can be excluded entirely. When you change goal models, though, it is important to capture the process in order to justify decisions that will inform the results. Similarly, pressures and resilience measures can be refined using local data and indicators. Index scores are only as good as the data on which they are based.
