Biodiversity:
People value biodiversity in particular for its existence value. The risk of species extinction generates great emotional and moral concern for many people. As such, this goal assesses the conservation status of species based on the best available global data through two sub-goals: Species and Habitats. Species were assessed because they are what one typically thinks of in relation to biodiversity. Because only a small proportion of marine species worldwide have been mapped and assessed, we also assessed Habitats as part of this goal, and considered them a proxy for condition of the broad suite of species that depend on them.

###Recommendations for regional assessments:

If comprehensive species biodiversity data exist, these data can be used alone and the sub-goal of habitats can be removed (so that the entire goal is species biodiversity). However, the inventory of marine biodiversity may not often be sufficiently complete to permit that.
