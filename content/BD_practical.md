### Practical Considerations

<!---Note from GitHub Issue #406-->

Note that SPP is the only goal with an upper and lower ref pt
if you have great data on SPP, you don't need the HAB part of the BD goal.

Species were assessed because they are what one typically thinks of in relation to biodiversity. Because only a small proportion of marine species worldwide have been mapped and assessed, we also assessed Habitats as part of this goal, and considered them a proxy for condition of the broad suite of species that depend on them.

##### Recommendations for regional assessments

If comprehensive species biodiversity data exist, these data can be used alone and the sub-goal of habitats can be removed (so that the entire goal is species biodiversity). However, the inventory of marine biodiversity may not often be sufficiently complete to permit that.
