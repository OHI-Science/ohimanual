#### Practical Considerations

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally, this goal would include some measure of how easy or hard it is for people to access ocean resources when they need them and a quantified evaluation of the sustainability of harvest of all nearshore stocks used by artisanal fishermen. The type of reference point used will depend on the data available.

#### Recommendations for your assessment

Regional assessments will likely modify the model using different or better-resolved data. This goal should be based on access: physical, economic, regulatory, and availability of stocksâ€”as much as data allow.  A combination of all of these would be best.
