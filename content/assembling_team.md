# Assembling a Team

<!---Add more--->

The success of your OHI+ assessment will depend on the effectiveness of your team. While every assessment will be done differently--it is always done according to local needs, resources, and priorities--we do have some guidance on suggested ways to go about assembling a team.

It is very important to have, for example, contacts who are experts in the following:

* R analysis
* Fisheries models
* Geospatial analyst (GIS or open-source software)
* Other Subject-Matter Experts to inform goal model decisions

Typically, team sizes have ranged from two to eight people. <!---From FAQ--->.

#### Case Study: The Baltic Health Index

One approach, for example, that has been very successful is to spread the goal model development across different team members. In the Baltic Health Index assessment, for example, each chosen goal has been assigned to a different "Goalkeeper," who is responsible for their technical team's development of goal models, data, as well as the appropriate stakeholder engagement. There is also a separate "Pressures" point-person and a separate "Resilience" point-person, which has proven to be an effective approach--since pressures and resilience are cross- cutting across goals, and the data for them are so important. The larger effort is then coordinated by another team member, who ensures that the goalkeepers are working toward the desired objective.

Effective assessments are carefully planned and require adequate project leadership and vision. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of the Index, assessments often count with participation of various stakeholder groups. Nevertheless, we recommend a key agency or group assumes the leadership of the assessment to ensure proper planning, development, and engagement throughout the assessment.
