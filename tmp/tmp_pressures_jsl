Resilience measures can be difficult to identify, because it is best to have more than whether regulation exists: you really want to understand how each region is performing based on those regulations. But this is not always possible.

and in the OHI calculations only values above a certain threshold will activate a corresponding pressure or resilience layer.

* Identify and categorize new local resilience measures (laws, regulatory process ranking, food-web integrity) not captured in the global resilience matrix.
* Set pressure and resilience weighting/ranking based on scientific literature and expert opinions.
