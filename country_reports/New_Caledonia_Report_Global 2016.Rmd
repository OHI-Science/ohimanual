# 2016 Ocean Health Index Global Assessment: `r country_name` Profile

This document provides a brief summary of the results for `r country_name` from the 2016 Ocean Health Index (OHI) Global Assessment. 

## Global results
As in previous years, this assessment updated datasets and methods to integrate new knowledge and information. The Index Global score for 2016, the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) area weighted average of region (countries and territories) scores, is 71. This value did not vary statistically significantly from 2012 to 2016.

![OHI 2016 Global Assessment Flower Plot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/draft/global2016/Reporting/figures/FlowerPlots/flower_GLOBAL_2016.png)

Several goals had significant changes:

### Improving scores
- Lasting special places scores increased by an average of 0.5 points per year
- Artisanal opportunities scores increased by just over 0.15 points per year
- Species condition scores improved by a small, but statistically significant, 0.03 points per year

### Declining scores
- Natural products declined by over 2.5 points per year on average
- Coastal protection declined by 0.12 points per year on average
- Clean waters declined by 0.15 points per year on average
- Species condition was ranked the goal with the highest score of 92, while mariculture was ranked the goal with the lowest score of 32.

## Methods and dataset updates
For 2016, all goals and subgoals were updated, except for livelihoods and economies and coastal protection (due to data availability limitations).

Additional years of data were available for the following goals/subgoals: artisanal opportunities, species condition, habitat and coastal protection (sea ice), mariculture, clean waters (land-based pollution), iconic species, lasting special places, natural products, tourism and recreation.

Improved data were available for the following goals/subgoals: fisheries, species condition (bird data are now included), clean waters (trash trends are calculated using actual trash data, rather than proxy population data), iconic species (trend is now directly estimated from data).

**Pressures:** Of the pressures data sets, 16 of the 20 pressure data layers were updated. Additional years of data for 7 pressures layers were added, and there were major improvements to source data for fisheries related pressures and sea level rise. Data from the Social Progress Index (http://www.socialprogressimperative.org/global-index/) was included as a “social” component of the pressure scores.
Resilience: We restructured the resilience data within the OHI, so the data and calculations are more transparent and easier to understand and update. Data from the Social Progress Index (http://www.socialprogressimperative.org/global-index/) was added as a “social” component of resilience scores. Only two resilience data layers were updated: species condition and marine protected areas.

## `r country_name`'s Results
The 2016 Index score for `r country_name` is of `r read_csv(file.path(dir_global, '/data/scores_eez2016.csv')) %>% filter(country == country_name) %>% select(Index)`. Ranking 10 out of 221 countries and territories assessed. 

```{r ranking countries, include = FALSE}

# d = read_csv(file.path(dir_global, '/data/scores_eez2016.csv')) %>% 

```

### 2012-2016 Scores for `r country_name` Using 2016 Methods

```{r scores all years, echo=FALSE}

data_all_years <- data.frame()

  mutate(year = scenarioYear)

data_all_years <- rbind(data_all_years, data)

}

         c('goal', '2012', '2013', '2014', '2015', '2016'))

```



<!-- ```{r plot scores} -->

<!-- country_score_plot_data <- country_score %>%  -->
<!--   gather(year, score, 2:6) -->

<!-- plot <- ggplot(country_score_plot_data) + -->
<!--   geom_point(aes(x = year, score, color = goal)) + -->
<!--   ggtitle('Goal scores 2012 - 2016') -->

<!-- print(plot) -->
<!-- ``` -->


### Improving scores
- Wild caught fisheries and food provision increased by 3 points each 

### Declining scores
- Clean waters declined by 7 points
- Tourism and recreation decreased by 8 points
- Sense of place decreased by 1 point

### Explanation of `r country_name`'s scores
The overall score for `r country_name` is `r read_csv(file.path(dir_global, '/data/scores_eez2016.csv')) %>% filter(country == country_name) %>% select(Index)`, which is 1 point lower than in 2015. Although New Caledonia continues to be one of the highest perfoming countries in the OHI Global Assessments, there were small decreases in clean waters due to trash and chemical pollution; this also affects sense of place. And, decreases in tourism and recreation imply that the percentage of the coastal population involved in this economic activity has declined.
