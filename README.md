# Introduction
  
## The Ocean Health Index

**The Ocean Health Index (OHI)** was created with a strong foundation in collaborative science and communications. Following the initial publication by [Halpern et al. 2012](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v488/n7413/abs/nature11397.html) in *Nature*, annual global assessments are now published to track changes in global ocean health in exclusive economic zones (EEZ), Antarctica, and the high seas. Furthermore, our team developed the regional assessment approach, recognizing the desire of countries to explore the variables affecting ocean health at smaller scales, where most management decisions are made. The team has been developing a suite of tools to facilitate this process: a comprehensive guide series, and the **Ocean Health Index Toolbox** software, which enables anyone to conduct assessments independently using the OHI framework. This **Ocean Health Index Manual** describes how to use the Toolbox software.

OHI scores by goal are calculated at the scale of the reporting unit, which is called a **region** and then combined using a weighted average to produce the score for the overall area assessed, called a **study area**. 


## The Ocean Health Index Toolbox

**The Ocean Helath Index Toolbox Application (App)** is open-source software developed to facilitate Index calculations at any scale. The Toolbox App runs using the statistical programming language R and displays input data and calculated scores graphically with maps, histograms, and tables. Goal scores are calculated for each region separately and then combined using a weighted average to produce the score for the overall study area assessed. Modifications can be made to the global studies, allowing calculation of scores with updated data that can then be visualized with the Toolbox App. 

The Toolbox can also be used to calculate scores in smaller-scale **regional assessments** after finer-scale data has been gathered and decisions have been made regarding goal models, pressures and resilience, and reference points. The Toolbox App therefore enables the Ocean Health Index framework to be customized to any area of interest, incorporating the data, indicators, and priorities regarding ocean-derived benefits that are relevant to informing decision-making in the chosen area. The App can also be used to compare how different management scenarios could affect overall ocean health, which can help identify effective strategies for managing local ocean and coastal resources in a sustainable manner.

Prior to beginning a regional assessment, we recommend exploring the methods and results of the global assessment, and becoming familiar with the Toolbox App.

**Requirements**: an Internet connection for the initial Toolbox App installation. The Toolbox runs on both a Mac and PC.

1. Install the latest versions of R (http://cran.r-project.org/) and R-Studion (http://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/), both of which are free
2. Launch the Toolbox Application (http://ohi-science.org/pages/install.html).
