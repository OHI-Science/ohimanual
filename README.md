# Introduction
  
## The Ocean Health Index

**The Ocean Health Index (OHI)** project was created with a strong foundation in communication and collaboration. Following the initial publication by Halpern *et al*. 2012 in *Nature*, we have conducted global assessments annually (in 2013, 2014, and ongoing), and have conducted smaller-scale assessments for the U.S. West Coast (Halpern *et al.* 2014), Fiji (Selig *et al.* in press), and Brazil (Elfes *et al.* 2014).

We have also developed the **OHI Toolbox** and **WebApps** to enable any group to conduct independent assessments using the OHI framework and modifying it to their needs. The Toolbox enables the OHI framework to be customized to any area of interest, incorporating whatever goals, data, indicators, and priorities regarding ocean-derived benefits that are relevant and available to the chosen spatial scale. Information is presented through the WebApps, which are used for orientation, visualization, and reporting.   

This manual provides information for: 

1. Planning an assessment
2. Navigating the OHI WebApp to visualize data at global and regional scales
3. Modifying data and models within the Toolbox for an independent assessment
4. Guidance for frequently asked questions and troubleshooting
