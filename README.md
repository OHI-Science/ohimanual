This is supporting documentation for OHI assessments.  
  
**The Ocean Health Index (OHI)** project was created with a strong foundation in communication and collaboration. Following the initial publication by [Halpern et al. 2012](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v488/n7413/abs/nature11397.html) in *Nature*, we have conducted annual global assessments to track changes in global ocean health. At the same time, we have been developing the **OHI Toolbox**: software that will enable others to conduct assessments on their own using the OHI framework.  
  
See the `.md` files within the [tutorials](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohimanual/tree/master/tutorials) for instructions on getting started with Ocean Health Index regional assessments.
